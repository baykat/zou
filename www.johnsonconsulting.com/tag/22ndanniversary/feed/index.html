<p>After 22 years of business consulting in the funeral profession, Johnson Consulting Group attributes its success to earning and maintaining the trust of their clients. Over its life span, the firm has provided <a href="https://www.johnsonconsulting.com/services/funeral-home-and-cemetery-business-brokers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">mergers &amp; acquisition services for funeral business</a> in every state in the U.S.</p>
<p>“I like to finish a client conversation with saying, ‘I appreciate your trust,’” said Jake Johnson, CEO of Johnson Consulting Group. “It’s an honor to be able to serve all of our clients and I appreciate the confidence they place in our team.”</p>
<p>As a company with roots steeped in being a family business, it’s only fitting that a commitment to improving the family experience remains a driving force for JCG. The team of experts at JCG keep a close pulse on the ever-changing funeral profession with an ability to work hand-in-glove with the client team. This partnership style allows the JCG team to work within the needs and goals of each client providing them with increased profitability and enterprise value with success at every stage of the business lifecycle. “I tell the team and our clients to think big and never ever apologize for thinking outside the box” …” Your success is limited by your vision,” said Johnson.</p>
<p>Twenty-two years brought with it both the expected and the unexpected. Lasting client relationships, over $2 billion in funeral business transactions, web-based accounting platforms, business coaching, leadership programs, technology offerings, and more. “I set high visions for our company and our team has always been up to this mighty challenge,” Johnson said. “We head into the next 22 years with an eye fixed on advancing our offerings for our clients. It’s an exciting time for JCG, we love growth as much as our clients do.”</p>
<p>“When we decided to take the next step for our business, there was only one company we considered to help us, Johnson Consulting. We have known the Johnson family for years and our respect and trust for them runs deep,” said Randy Shoedinger of Schoedinger Funeral and Cremation. “Their team was excellent at keeping everything on track through closing and we greatly appreciate their expertise throughout.”</p>
