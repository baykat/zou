<p><strong><u>Scottsdale, AZ –</u></strong>Johnson Consulting Group (JCG) announced the recipients of the <strong><em>JCG 2024 Excellence in Customer Service Awards, powered by J3Tech Solutions.</em></strong></p>

The Overall Performance Score is a calculation of eighteen independent questions that measure results in four areas: 1) Initial Contact, 2) Arranging Director, 3) Facilities and Vehicles, 4) Staff and Services Provided.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The JCG client funeral homes are divided into three categories based on call volume. Award recipients achieved the highest levels of customer satisfaction among the 576 funeral homes that were eligible in 2024.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.johnsonconsulting.com/services/performance-tracker-x/">JCG Performance Tracker X</a> tool provides funeral homes and cemeteries timely, accurate measurements of customer service and sale performance.  The software offers comprehensive reporting that shows business owners what they are doing well and identifies the areas that need fine-tuning and improvements.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Johnson Consulting Group started its customer survey program in 2008. This large amount of survey data has proven invaluable to providing insight into customer needs and satisfaction. The company attributes the program’s growth based on its ability to offer the program with no contract to sign, a low monthly cost, and accessibility to its management professionals for interpretation and usefulness of the reports.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“With the commoditization of products and services in our society, providing an exceptionally high level of customer service is critical to differentiating us from our competition. At the average sale of a funeral today, the loss of even one family can have material impacts on a business and its value. The answer to continual improvement is to survey our customers, ask the difficult questions, ask for a review online, and recover when there&#8217;s an issue”, says Jake Johnson, President and CEO of Johnson Consulting Group.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Scottsdale, AZ [September 27th, 2023]</strong></p>
<p>The Funeral Service Foundation announced today that it has received a $100,000 contribution from the Memorial Classic Golf Tournament.  The Memorial Classic was founded by Tom Johnson more than 40 years ago with the intent of bringing together friends in funeral service together for fellowship. With more than 136 participants every year, the tournament is a philanthropic force that gives back to the funeral service profession.</p>
<p>Since 2010, the Memorial Classic Golf Tournament has contributed more than $744,000 to the Funeral Service Foundation and has created the Foundation’s permanently endowed Memorial Classic Scholarship, the impact of which continues to grow. Since 2013, 27 students pursuing their mortuary science degrees at accredited institutions have received the Memorial Classic Scholarships.</p>
<p>“As a lifelong professional we are excited to give back and help the funeral profession educate the next generation of leading minds,” said President and CEO of Johnson Consulting Group, Jake Johnson.</p>
<p><strong>About the Memorial Classic Scholarship:</strong><br />
Named in memory of some of the funeral profession’s finest – Bill Bischoff, Mike Fleming, Dave Hirt, Steve Mack, John Morrow, Ed Murphy, Mike Stephens, Ed Tuggle and Joe Weatherford – the endowed scholarship at the Funeral Service Foundation is funded through proceeds from the annual Memorial Classic Golf Tournament, which is lead by Tom and Jake Johnson of Johnson Consulting Group.</p>
<p>“This generous gift and the continued legacy of giving from Memorial Classic, the Johnson family, and all who participate continues to open doors for so many who feel called to work in the funeral service profession,” said Funeral Service Foundation Board Chair, Mark Krause. “These gifts that honor and memorialize some of the funeral profession’s greatest advocates ensures that their legacy lives on in the opportunities for compassion and care that this scholarship creates.”</p>
<p><strong>About the Funeral Service Foundation &#8211; </strong><br />
Since 1945, the Funeral Service Foundation has served as the philanthropic voice of the funeral profession and has identified as the charitable arm of the National Funeral Directors Association since 1997. Donors and volunteer leaders profession-wide support the Foundation in its mission to lift up grieving communities by investing in people and programs that strengthen funeral service.</p>

]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Business valuations are a crucial resource for understanding precisely how much your funeral home or cemetery business is worth. Armed with the right information and insights, you can more effectively understand your business’s positioning and plan for the rest of the year. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As we head into the second quarter of 2023, it’s essential to—if you haven’t already—obtain a valuation for your funeral business. If you’re not convinced, here are four reasons why you shouldn’t delay.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">1. Understand Your Business Health</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Most planning meetings begin by recapping prior goals and their outcomes. While there are a number of metrics that can indicate the health of your funeral business (profit and loss statements, balance sheets, employee turnover rates), </span><a href="https://www.johnsonconsulting.com/what-goes-into-a-funeral-home-valuation/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a full-fledged valuation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> takes everything into account and distills it into a number. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This number provides a top-down overview of how your business is currently performing, and it serves as the benchmark for both the near and long term.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">2. Identify Strengths and Weaknesses</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While a business valuation can be represented as a simple number, a proper valuation also includes all of the constitutive elements that lead to this number. So while your valuation will provide a benchmark of your business’s performance, one that makes it easy to compare to industry competitors, it will also provide you with an in-depth analysis of your business’s strengths and weaknesses. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A professional valuation will not only look at financial reporting, but it will also analyze many other things such as a funeral home’s management, market share, and future earnings prospects. From these more granular observations, your leadership team can determine what’s working and what could work better. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">3. Set Goals for the Year</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once you’ve thoroughly assessed the current positioning of your business, you can begin </span><a href="https://www.johnsonconsulting.com/strategic-plan/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">creating your strategic plan</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Using your valuation as the jumping-off point, you’ll create a series of objectives that aim to increase the value of your business. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, if your business is struggling with high turnover rates, you might create a plan for </span><a href="https://www.johnsonconsulting.com/how-to-recruit-and-retain-top-talent-for-your-funeral-business/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">employee recruitment and retention</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Similarly, if your sales team is struggling to fill your backlog of preneed sales, you may want to review outsourcing that functionality or what programs are being used, such as Lunch and Learns. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ultimately, all of these goals, when executed properly, will lead to a more favorable valuation. In fact, the subsequent valuation can help you evaluate the success of these initiatives.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">4. Plan Your Exit Strategy</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even if you don’t plan on selling your funeral business in the near future, it’s essential to </span><a href="https://www.johnsonconsulting.com/plan-your-exit-strategy/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">develop an exit strategy</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> as early as you can. Unless you plan on living forever, you’ll eventually need to sell your funeral business — and a business valuation is a crucial resource during the selling process.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It could take more than a year to make the proper adjustments to get your valuation in an optimal place for sale. Because of this, it’s essential to know your current valuation and how far it may fall short from your goal valuation for a sale. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Planning your succession in the funeral business can be a tricky process that often requires lawyers, brokers, accountants, and other funeral business owners. If you’re looking to learn the ins and outs of exit planning, then you should consider enrolling in the </span><a href="https://www.johnsonconsulting.com/services/jcg-academy"><span style="font-weight: 400;">JCG Academy for Leadership and Management</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Understand Your Business’s Worth with JCG</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While a simple valuation can be performed in a matter of minutes using the revenue multiple method, this shorthand valuation neglects the more nuanced components of your business and its cashflow earning potential. When it comes time to sell your business and a professional valuation is required, the resulting number will be different. Because of this, you should seek the help of experts. </span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.johnsonconsulting.com/services/valuation-services/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Johnson Consulting Group provides valuation services</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that analyze your company’s historical performance and future projections. As well as examining your company’s financial records and operational structure, JCG will also compare your business to the greater marketplace, allowing the valuation to provide you with an accurate assessment of your funeral business’s value range. In the event that the valuation comes back less than you’d anticipated, the JCG team can also provide you with </span><a href="https://www.johnsonconsulting.com/services/business-consulting/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">consulting services</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that improve your business’s value. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For funeral businesses of any size and at any stage in their life cycle, Johnson Consulting Group can help you prepare for the future, both in 2023 and beyond. </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Questions to ask yourself as a business owner:</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As we near the end of the calendar year, you might be thinking about the status of your business. Are you growing in the ways you had hoped?

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Methods of growing and building value:</h2>

You might be surprised by what you find. It’s possible you could see a specific area of your business taking the lead, an indication you should put focus there. Taking the next step of an in depth <a href="https://www.johnsonconsulting.com/neglecting-a-swot-analysis-dont-do-it-heres-why/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SWOT analysis</a> for your </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">funeral business</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> could lead you to the right growth opportunities at the right time.</span></p>
<h3></h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>In sync staff:</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Having a staff that is truly in sync with your business goals is another key to growth.

It’s a great way to balance sales with the compassion and sensitive needs of your customers.</span></p>
<h3></h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Mindset:</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We’ve touched on some of the more concrete, analytic things that are important to business growth, so let’s turn to some ideas that are a little more intangible. Bringing a positive mindset with you each day is very important. This article from </span><a href="https://www.entrepreneur.com/living/positive-thinking-will-change-your-life-and-business/432740" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Entrepreneur</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> expands on the idea that thinking positively when it comes to yourself and your business can have a big impact on those around you as well as on the ultimate success of your business.</span></p>
