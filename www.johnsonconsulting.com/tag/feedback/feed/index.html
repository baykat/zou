										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Providing outstanding customer service is a universal goal for businesses, but how do we truly know we’re meeting the mark? Assumptions are not enough. Instead, it requires a systematic approach to evaluate, analyze, and enhance the service we offer. Here’s a step-by-step guide to transforming your customer service process and driving continuous improvement.</p>
<h2><strong>1.The Service…Start with Self-Reflection</strong></h2>
<p>Before seeking external feedback, begin by assessing your current service delivery. This requires vulnerability—being open to recognizing shortcomings and embracing opportunities for growth. Evaluate your processes, interactions, and touchpoints. Where could improvements be made? Honest reflection sets the stage for meaningful progress.</p>
<h2><strong>2.Gather Client Feedback</strong></h2>
<p>Once you’ve acknowledged areas for improvement, the next step is to collect insights directly from your customers. <a href="https://youtu.be/UCbpHRqLhVg?si=IKAOcyZwlN-VMB4b" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Customer satisfaction surveys</a> are an excellent tool for this purpose. These can be distributed digitally (email), via text, or through traditional mail (paper).</p>
<p>Focus on these key areas:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>First Point of Contact</strong>: Often the lowest-rated section in surveys. Ask how the family’s initial interaction with your business felt and identify gaps.</li>
<li><strong>Arrangement Process</strong>: Gather feedback on the ease and efficiency of the arrangement process.  How did the arranger listen and provide the options?</li>
<li><strong>Facilities and Appearance</strong>: Evaluate impressions of your facilities, vehicles, and surroundings.  Have you provided a comfortable and quality environment for the customer.</li>
<li><strong>Service Experience</strong>: For those who utilized your service, dig deeper into their experience.</li>
</ul>
<p>Further questions should include perceptions of the overall value, how customers discovered you, their willingness to leave online reviews, and suggestions for additional services (lead generation).</p>
<h2><strong>3.Act on Feedback Quickly…Real Time Data</strong></h2>
<p>In the movie, “<em>The Godfather”</em>, bad news was expected to be delivered promptly! Similarly, receiving real-time data allows you to address issues immediately rather than letting them go unchecked.  <a href="https://www.johnsonconsulting.com/services/performance-tracker-x/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Johnson Consulting’s Performance Tracker System</a> allows you to leverage the latest technology, providing a rapid response to customer concerns.</p>
<h2><strong>4.Analyze the Data</strong></h2>
<p>Collecting feedback is only valuable if you analyze it effectively. Use robust reporting platforms to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Filter data by time frame, location, or region.</li>
<li>Identify trends and actionable insights.</li>
<li>Generate reports in real time for prompt decision-making.</li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>5.Deploy Actionable Improvements</strong></h2>
<p>With insights in hand, it’s time to implement changes. Review the data with your management team and assign tasks for execution. Ask:</p>
<ul>
<li>What improvements can we make?</li>
<li>Who will be responsible for these changes?</li>
<li>What is the timeline for implementation?</li>
</ul>
<p>Accountability and clear timelines ensure that your efforts translate into measurable results.</p>
<h2><strong>6.Invest in CX Performance Improvement</strong></h2>
<p>Customer experience (CX) isn’t a one-time fix; it requires ongoing commitment. Consider hosting <a href="https://www.johnsonconsulting.com/services/jcg-academy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Johnson Consulting’s CX performance improvement workshops</a> to bolster your service culture. John DiJulius’s book “<em><a href="https://thedijuliusgroup.com/product/the-customer-service-revolution/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Customer Service Revolution</a>”</em> is an excellent resource for understanding how to create a customer-first approach.</p>
<h2><strong>7.Generate Leads Through Exceptional Service</strong></h2>
<p>Satisfied customers naturally become ambassadors for your business. By prioritizing CX and deploying actionable improvements, you create raving fans who are eager to share their experiences. Encourage them to leave online reviews and share testimonials. This not only generates leads but also strengthens your reputation.</p>
<h2><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2>
<p>Customer service excellence is a continuous cycle. Start with honest self-assessment, gather and act on client feedback, analyze data, and implement changes. Invest in your team’s growth through CX workshops, and reap the rewards of lead generation from loyal, satisfied customers. Then, begin the process again to ensure ongoing improvement.</p>
<p>By following these steps, you’ll not only elevate your service standards but also foster a culture of excellence that drives lasting success.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Communication is key in any relationship, and in a professional environment, regular reviews are a crucial part of developing that communication between the leader and their team. When conducted properly, performance reviews allow supervisors to fairly assess their team members and implement actionable next steps. Ultimately, evaluating your staff will enable you to engage them further, provide recognition, and create opportunities for their growth. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">From a productivity standpoint, implementing these conversations fosters a performance culture and improves the workplace environment.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By adeptly implementing staff evaluations, your team will have yet another tool to succeed. Here&#8217;s how to do it right. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Make It Regular</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some businesses formally review their employees as often as every quarter, while others opt for yearly reviews. Regardless of the frequency you choose, the important thing is to establish a regular review period, allowing your team to know what to expect and when to prepare. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That said, if your leadership team opts for annual reviews, then you should still conduct less formal check-ins on a monthly basis. This type of meeting will allow you to address smaller, more immediate concerns. Often known as monthly 1:1s, these check-ins help employees understand where they stand and address any issues before the more formal annual review. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Standardize</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When conducting annual reviews, you&#8217;ll want to follow the same format each year so team members know what to expect. Additionally, this will help you maintain a level of consistency and ensure you don&#8217;t miss any important steps. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To accomplish this, funeral businesses should develop a written outline for the review format. On this outline, you should note each area in which you&#8217;re evaluating team members. For example, you&#8217;ll likely want to touch on communication, problem-solving, and punctuality in every team member&#8217;s review. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We also recommend including self-assessment as part of the process. Have employees evaluate themselves prior to the review, then discuss the employee’s self-assessment. From there, the manager can provide additional comments and feedback.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Focus on the Positive</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When conducting evaluations of team members, it&#8217;s essential to focus on the positive aspects of the review. According to </span><a href="https://hbr.org/2013/03/the-ideal-praise-to-criticism"><span style="font-weight: 400;">research from Harvard</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, top-performing teams give each other about 5.6x more positive feedback than negative feedback. That means it’s best to provide employees with almost six positive comments for every piece of criticism.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even if there are areas where the employee could improve, setting clear expectations and providing a supportive learning environment can turn the feedback into a positive experience rather than criticism.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When providing feedback, it&#8217;s important to focus on the work being performed rather than the person. Otherwise, criticism may feel like a personal attack. For example, rather than saying, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">You are unprofessional</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, you might consider saying, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Your frequent tardiness to team meetings has hindered our ability to work together. </span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Along with feedback, take some time to acknowledge and reward everything the employee does well. Employees who understand their strengths can lean into those and continue accomplishing exceptional work in their role.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Provide specific examples when possible. Rather than telling a team member that they consistently demonstrate empathy toward families, point out a particular instance in which they went above and beyond to make a family feel special. Rooting your feedback in specific actions helps your team understand how they can continue to excel where they are strong and troubleshoot areas in which they fall short. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Receive Feedback</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the same way that you must evaluate your staff, you should also give them an opportunity to evaluate your performance. Being a good manager means ensuring that your team has the tools and resources they need to perform. Receiving feedback from your team will allow you to see how you stand to grow as a leader. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Often, it&#8217;s helpful to request this feedback anonymously, as team members are often hesitant to critique their superiors.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Make an Action Plan</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">No employee evaluation is complete without a follow-up plan of action. After finishing an employee review, you&#8217;ll want to create goals and expectations for the following year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These goals can take many forms. It may be an opportunity to work on individual challenges, or better align employees toward the goals of the company as a whole.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If an employee has performed exceptionally in their role, you can create a plan for them to take on additional responsibilities. Alternatively, if a team member&#8217;s performance has lagged, you can outline expectations they can strive for to improve performance. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In either case, your leadership should offer the training, tools, and resources the employee needs to succeed. Listening and offering this sort of support is crucial to employee morale and </span><a href="https://www.johnsonconsulting.com/how-to-recruit-and-retain-top-talent-for-your-funeral-business/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">retaining top talent</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Document Everything</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Every component of your staff evaluations should be documented. The evaluation itself, your staff&#8217;s feedback for leadership, and the goals you put in place should all be accessible to the relevant members of your team. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This gives you something to refer to during the next annual review, and it will answer some key questions:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Did the team member meet their goals?</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Were issues of the last review addressed?</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Did leadership provide the extra support that was promised? </span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Annual reviews will provide the benchmarks of success for each of your team members. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reward Your Team</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In many cases, positive annual reviews will come with a raise or bonus commensurate with the employee&#8217;s performance and the overall success of your funeral home. Another way to reward your team members is through introducing </span><a href="https://www.johnsonconsulting.com/services/business-consulting/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">incentive compensation plans</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. By creating a system in which team members are rewarded with bonuses, you can motivate exceptional performance, while aligning them with the companies goals. </span></p>

<p>Picture it: One June morning, two people wake up and get a call from an old friend telling them that a childhood classmate just died. They want to know more—so, over breakfast, they each take the natural first step and search online for an obituary.</p>
<p>One person finds the correct notice at the top of their search results. The other finds broken links to the wrong person. One of them attends the memorial service the funeral home hosts that afternoon. The other misses the service, has no idea what a beautiful job the funeral home did, and keeps their potential future business with them at their kitchen table.</p>
<p>What could cause such dramatically different results?</p>
<p>To find out, Legacy analyzed the search results of two major multi-rooftop funeral homes with similar market size and demographics. Both invest in robust websites where they publish high-quality obituaries. Their only key difference: One of these homes syndicates, or shares, their obituaries to a larger audience through a distribution partner. And the other doesn’t.</p>
<p>Take a guess which one had the results the searcher, and the funeral home, both wanted.</p>

<p>Syndication means, simply, distributing the same content in as many places as possible. It’s how Associated Press news stories run in all the newspapers.

<p>To see these results in action, Legacy google-searched the name of a recent deceased at those two funeral homes, together with the word “obit.”</p>
<p>For the first funeral home—let’s call them Desert State Mortuary—we found the obituary we needed immediately at the top. Right beneath these results followed more good links, including social media posts sharing the correct obituary with friends and family of the deceased. In other words: people who would care about attending the funeral, and who therefore could turn into leads. These people all saw the funeral home’s brand prominently at every step of this online journey.</p>
<p>But when we performed the same kind of search for the second home—we’ll call them Sun Belt Funerals and Cremation—the search results page <em>did not show us the correct obituary</em>. Just a bunch of wrong links to the wrong deaths.</p>

<p>Every day, the people in your town read the obits. Mostly, these days, they read them on their phones. But here’s the thing: In order to read <em>your </em>obits and then attend <em>your </em>services, they have to be able to find them.</p>
<p>“No one can read an obit they can’t find,” says Tom Antram, President and CEO of French Funerals &amp; Cremations. “It’s only valuable content if people see it.”</p>
<p>This is what syndication does. It puts your name at the top of search results, and also on the second, and third, and fourth results. This perk—your funeral home name and accurate information displaying across multiple top results—is key, because, as Ryan Thogmartin,  funeral home marketing expert and CEO of Disrupt Media, points out: “Your funeral home will <em>never</em> be the only search result. Google just doesn’t work that way.”</p>
<p>The good news: Google search results strive to put authoritative content first. When your name and website appear early in the search engine listings, you are branded as an authority and trusted source. Syndicated content is vital to telling Google: <em>My funeral home is legit, and this is the obituary your searcher wants</em>. It gives you more control over those first-page listings.</p>
<p>But the funeral home who isolates their notices on their website leaves Google without good, accurate content. Google has to fill all the slots on that first page. What’s a search engine to do?</p>

<p>As the results for Sun Belt Funerals and Cremation prove: Left to its own devices, a search engine will always make some dicey choices. It’s an algorithm, after all, not a person who understands that “Willie X of Abbeville, LA” is not the same as “Willie X of Port Arthur, TX.” Because Desert State Mortuary syndicated their notices with a distribution partner, they successfully owned the content from the first result down. Their name was front-and-center. Not only did the results prominently display their website, but the rest of the front-page results were also accurate and branded to their funeral home. Desert State Mortuary ultimately owned 87% of the click-through rate for the test search. That’s a lot of clicks, and a lot of people. And the funeral home that isolated their obituaries, Sun Belt Funerals and Cremation, left 70% of them behind.</p>

<h2><strong>Get Them In the Door</strong></h2>
<p>Obits are branding for your funeral home. The more someone sees your funeral home name as they read notices, the more repetitive marketing they’re exposed to. This puts you top-of-mind when that obit reader needs end-of-life help.</p>
<p>But obits are also a vital link for your most important source of leads: in-person services. That’s because <strong>85% of people are still far more likely to share news about a death via an online source than anywhere else</strong><strong> </strong>(Legacy.com survey of end-of-life consumers).</p>
<p>The best marketing is traffic through your doors. Getting those visitors requires broad distribution and reach for your brand in your community. Obits are ideal for this role: people can’t attend services they don’t know about. The more they read your obits, the more likely they’ll come in to your facility and be exposed to your business and brand. We know in-person services will be coming back soon. Are you ready to reach all the people who want to attend?</p>
<p>And those pre-planners who make your budgeting so much easier to manage? Obits are key to their leads, too. <strong>Remember, the #1 prompt for funeral pre-planners is the death of someone they know</strong><strong> </strong>(Source: 2019 Legacy.com pre-planner consumer survey).</p>

<p>When someone searches online for one of your funerals, what will they find? With syndicated content, they’ll find you. Then they’ll walk through your doors and become the next family you meet.</p>
<p>“Your website is only one tool, and it isn’t even the most important one,” says Welton Hong,  CEO of funeral home marketing service provider Ring-Ring Marketing. “You need people to see your name<em>,</em> as often as possible, all over the place.”</p>
<p>Leads. Brand exposure. Revenue opportunities. Traffic and market insights. Syndicated obituaries deliver all these benefits, at no-cost and with no additional effort.</p>
<p>“The purpose of an obituary is to tell the community, ‘This person died, funeral services will be held at <em>this</em> day and time at <em>this</em> funeral home to remember them,’” says Buddy Phaneuf, president of Phaneuf Funeral Homes and Crematorium. “Your potential for future business are the people who walk through your doors. Why <em>wouldn’t </em>you want to share that information with as many people as possible?”</p>
<p>The question isn’t whether or not syndication works. The question is, are you syndicating? If not, why not?</p>

]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Every moment after the loss of a loved one holds great meaning for a bereaved family. As such, each interaction between your funeral home and a family in need must be well thought-out from start to finish. Making sure the families have a positive experience from the moment they walk in the door is the key to building strong customer loyalty.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is an honor to work in the funeral and cemetery profession. Providing professional and compassionate service to a family during one of the worst times of their lives is truly a higher calling. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, designing personal and memorable funeral experiences shouldn’t take a backseat to measuring customer satisfaction. Families that are satisfied with their funeral home experience are more likely to share their story with others and recommend your services to the community. This kind of organic advertising is the best way to sustain financial success.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Get Honest Feedback</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So how does a funeral home go about measuring customer engagement and satisfaction? To start, you need to have something to measure. Funeral directors can collect meaningful data by simply asking</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">clients for feedback on their overall experience with the funeral home. You can request customer input in person after the service or via online surveys that can be filled out on your website. You can also mail out survey forms to your families, but make sure you include a pre-paid return envelope.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What kind of survey questions draw out sincere responses and honest feedback? Here are some useful ideas and strategies that can help you get the right data inputs to help you measure your funeral home’s customer experience. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">First Impressions Count</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As the saying goes, “You never get a second chance to make a first impression.” A family’s first contact with your funeral home, whether it’s on the phone or in person, is a crucial building block. Some questions that can help you analyze a customer&#8217;s initial thoughts might include:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">How was the family greeted? </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Is the greeting consistently applied at all times? </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">How responsive was the staff?</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Managing first impressions can provide meaningful data on how well your funeral home interacts with pre-need and/or at-need clients.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Arrangement Conversations</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The arrangement meeting can make or break a family&#8217;s opinion of your funeral home. Funeral directors are trained to effectively manage the planning conversation, but there is always room for improvement when it comes to enhancing the experience for the bereaved family. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Strong communication skills are vital to this process, for example, how attentive are you to the customer’s needs? Do you ask open-ended questions that allow the family to share stories about their loved one? How do you show that you are listening? Funeral arrangers must be able to listen well, show empathy, and recognize body language cues to drive the conversation on a deeper level.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another element to consider is organization. Ask, is the arrangement conference well structured? Does the family understand all of the product and service options available? Clear communication of what your funeral home offers enables the family to make informed decisions based on their personal and financial preferences. Combining all of these elements into the arrangement meeting will have a positive impact on customer experience and provide valuable insight for enhancing the conversation.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Do Looks Matter?</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The appearance of your funeral home definitely matters. Customers judge the presentation of your staff and facilities, and if they see something they don’t like it’s often the first thing they share with others regarding their experience. Unfortunately, bad news always spreads faster than good news, so funeral homes need to manage all aspects of their image accordingly. To prevent bad news, ask yourself these crucial questions:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Is your funeral home clean and well-maintained?</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Are your funeral vehicles comfortable and in good working condition?</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Is your staff professional and accommodating?</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Are your facilities clean, organized and accessible?</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Paying attention to the small details will keep your customers happy and improve your funeral home’s performance reviews. These metrics can be easily measured with survey questions or a simple feedback form.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Price vs. Value</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A funeral is an expensive undertaking. Funeral directors should inform families about all the available options and discuss the costs and fees associated with each choice. Planning a funeral or memorial often causes emotional and financial stress, so it’s important to clearly explain the value of your funeral home’s services and expertise in relation to price</span></p>
