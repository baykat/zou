<p>The <a href="https://www.johnsonconsulting.com/services/performance-tracker-x/">JCG Performance Tracker X</a> tool provides funeral homes and cemeteries timely, accurate measurements of customer service and sale performance.  The software offers comprehensive reporting that shows business owners what they are doing well and identifies the areas that need fine-tuning and improvements.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Johnson Consulting Group started its customer survey program in 2008. This large amount of survey data has proven invaluable to providing insight into customer needs and satisfaction. The company attributes the program’s growth based on its ability to offer the program with no contract to sign, a low monthly cost, and accessibility to its management professionals for interpretation and usefulness of the reports.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“With the commoditization of products and services in our society, providing an exceptionally high level of customer service is critical to differentiating us from our competition. At the average sale of a funeral today, the loss of even one family can have material impacts on a business and its value. The answer to continual improvement is to survey our customers, ask the difficult questions, ask for a review online, and recover when there&#8217;s an issue”, says Jake Johnson, President and CEO of Johnson Consulting Group.</p>

<p>In our latest Johnson Consulting Conversations, we spoke with Suzanne Akre, Founder and CEO of Akre &amp; Associates and Akre Legacy Recruiting. With over 30 years of recruiting experience, Suzanne shared valuable insights about recruiting in the funeral service profession.</p>
<p>Suzanne never set out to recruit for funeral service—it found her. About a decade ago, her firm began recruiting leaders for an organization serving the death care industry. As her network grew, she discovered that funeral homes, cemeteries, suppliers, and death-tech companies share a common challenge—finding qualified talent.</p>
<p>One challenge that Suzanne often encounters is funeral provider clients being able to give enough time to the hiring process.  She understands how busy a funeral owner or manager can be and is committed to keeping all parties involved updated.</p>
<p>In discussing missed opportunities for prospective candidates Suzanne mentioned that funeral directors rarely manage their brand, making traditional recruiting tools ineffective. Most don&#8217;t have a professional social media presence and are so dedicated to serving families that they don&#8217;t focus on their career growth. Even professionals desperate for change hesitate to take the first step. With that in mind Suzanne established<br />
www.akrelegacyrecruiting.com, creating a landing spot for both funeral providers and professionals seeking career changes.</p>
<p>Suzanne&#8217;s recruitment process begins with learning about the company&#8217;s culture, staff, role history, families served, compensation, growth opportunities, and onboarding. After securing an agreement, her team sources talent, facilitates interviews, and manages the entire process through to placement and beyond.</p>
<p>Timeframes for filling positions vary significantly but on average it takes three to six months to complete the process.  Factors affecting this timeline include geographic challenges, candidate response times, interview scheduling priorities, compensation packages, counteroffers, and relocation issues.</p>
<p>We discussed common mistakes that can be avoided. &#8220;Time kills deals!&#8221; Suzanne emphasized when identifying hiring mistakes. Taking too long to engage candidates, allowing toxic employees to participate in interviews, providing incomplete offer letters, assuming automatic trust, and conducting impersonal interviews are common pitfalls that cost funeral homes top talent.</p>
<p>It was interesting to hear Suzanne’s perspective on what today&#8217;s funeral service professionals seek in workplaces that value them personally and professionally. They want guilt-free PTO, mental well-being support, clear advancement paths, mentorship, and supportive leadership. When choosing employers, they prioritize compensation, location, culture, colleague attitudes, and relocation assistance.</p>
<p>Successful funeral homes build strong teams by offering competitive compensation, implementing thorough onboarding, treating employees exceptionally well, acknowledging community involvement, providing encouragement, and having owners who actively support their staff.</p>
<p>The next generation of funeral directors brings different expectations. Most weren&#8217;t born into this business and many experienced a personal death young, giving them a deep drive to help others. They expect fair pay, mentorship, career growth, mental health support, clear communication, and technology integration.</p>
<p>As an instructor at Worsham College of Mortuary Science, I&#8217;ve observed these shifting mindsets firsthand. Today&#8217;s students are passionate about serving families while seeking balance. They&#8217;re tech-savvy and ask more questions during interviews about schedules, mentorship, and growth opportunities.</p>
<p>We talked in depth about second-career professionals who do differ notably from new first-career graduates. As Suzanne perfectly stated, second-career professionals have &#8220;already done difficult things&#8221; and know their capacity for hard work. Many are drawn to funeral service by personal experiences and bring higher emotional intelligence with less fear of the field. It’s not uncommon for them to have held management positions.  It’s important to know they expect independence and seek leadership opportunities sooner.</p>
<p>Suzanne shared valuable advice for funeral service professionals wanting to stay competitive.  First, keep developing technology skills, work on public speaking abilities, update professional online profiles, leverage networking capabilities, and consider attending compassion cultivation training.</p>
<p>For mortuary students, Suzanne recommends building a professional brand, maintaining a professional social media presence, finding mentors, joining community organizations, developing healthy habits, and remembering their crucial role in guiding families through difficult times. In my Worsham College role, I emphasize that technical skills alone won&#8217;t guarantee success. The graduates who thrive combine interpersonal abilities, adaptability, and commitment to learning with their technical knowledge.</p>
<p>The insights from our conversation highlight the evolving landscape of funeral service recruiting. By focusing on culture, professional development, and adapting to today&#8217;s workforce expectations, funeral providers can succeed in an increasingly competitive market.

<p>Join us for our next conversation with Amanda Hill of Female Forward on April 9th, discussing how funeral providers can better market to female consumers.</p>

<p class="p1">We started with a key concept: the distinction between cold and hot leaders. Jill said to imagine cold leads as people who might be curious about pre-arranging their funeral but aren&#8217;t quite ready to commit. They&#8217;re like explorers, gathering information and weighing options. On the flip side, hot leads are prepared to dive in—they&#8217;ve decided to pre-arrange and are searching for the right partner to help them. The magic lies in transforming those curious explorers into committed clients. This transformation is no small feat and demands a dynamic blend of traditional wisdom and <a href="https://www.johnsonconsulting.com/services/performance-tracker-x/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cutting-edge funeral home technology</a>.</p>
<p class="p1">We know that community outreach is the heartbeat of connection. It&#8217;s where the real excitement happens for making meaningful connections in the community. Jill and I discussed how funeral homes can become trusted advisors in their communities by engaging in genuine outreach. Jill suggested hosting engaging events like movie nights for Veterans or an informative seminar on Veteran death benefits. Events like this cost trust and familiarity. The secret sauce is focusing on relationships, not sales pitches. It&#8217;s about being a trusted friend, not just another business.</p>
<p class="p1">In our fast-paced digital age, you might think direct mail has gone the way of the dinosaurs. Jill shared that direct mail is still a powerhouse. Sending a physical mailer often leads to warmer client interactions than digital alternatives. Why? Because receiving and responding to mail requires a level of commitment that clicks and likes simply don&#8217;t capture. Combining direct mail with social media for events can bring in similar numbers of leads, but the mail leads often close with more success. It&#8217;s all about finding that sweet spot between tradition and innovation.</p>
<p class="p1">Jill and I discussed personalization in marketing, which is more than a trend; it&#8217;s a necessity. Jill stressed that it&#8217;s about making every potential client feel recognized and valued. Recommendations from Jill included using videos and staff photos in marketing materials to send personalized video messages. There are endless ways to make connections feel personal and genuine. The goal is to have potential clients walk through the funeral home doors feeling like they already know you.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Last year Jill posted a video on LinkedIn showing off her cat on National Cat Day. That video turned out to be her most viewed video because it was personal, genuine and it included a pet which was a suggestion from her co-worker.</p>
<p class="p1">Every community is unique, with its own culture and preferences. One size definitely doesn&#8217;t fit all in funeral service marketing. Jill stated that success depends on knowing your audience and tailoring your messages to meet their specific needs. This approach addresses natural sales resistance and positions the funeral director or pre-need consultant as a compassionate advisor. By doing so, you build lasting relationships based on understanding and empathy.</p>
<p class="p1">We know that technology is revolutionizing nearly all industries and different types of businesses. One fascinating idea we explored was the concept of an &#8220;empty cart&#8221; feature on <a href="https://www.johnsonconsulting.com/funeral-home-website-needs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">funeral home websites</a>. People can plan their end-of-life services online, just like shopping on Amazon. This tool provides valuable insights into client preferences. We must remember that technology is only as effective as the people behind it. Ensure your team is well-trained and enthusiastic about using these tools for the best results. Jill mentioned the opportunities that exist when an online consumer has a full shopping cart but doesn&#8217;t check out.</p>
<p class="p1">Patience is a virtue, especially when measuring marketing success in funeral service. Jill advocates for a 12-month evaluation period—pre-need marketing programs often reveal their true potential over time. This patient approach helps avoid hasty judgments and allows strategies to flourish fully.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Balancing tradition with innovation will be crucial for a <a href="https://www.johnsonconsulting.com/enhance-funeral-preneed-sales/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">funeral provider&#8217;s pre-need success</a>. It&#8217;s not about choosing between old and new—it&#8217;s about discovering the perfect blend that resonates with your community.</p>
<p class="p1">Thank you, Jill, for joining us on Johnson Consulting Conversations! Below is the recording in case you missed it live. Be sure to watch the surprise at the end for her and Welton Hong, Founder of Ring Ring Marketing.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Lessons from the Field Derrick Husmann&#039;s Experiences with DMORT in Disaster Response" width="1080" height="608" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Bmif7NwSOdU?feature=oembed"  allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p1">In the most recent Johnson Consulting Conversation, I introduced <a href="https://www.johnsonconsulting.com/about/our-team/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Derrick Hussman</a>, Senior Business Consultant for Johnson Consulting Group and a dedicated member of the Disaster Mortuary Operational Response Team (DMORT). Derrick&#8217;s journey in the funeral service industry is as captivating as it is inspiring. From considering a career in broadcasting to finding his calling in forensics and funeral service, Derrick&#8217;s path is a testament to the power of guidance, passion, and willingness to serve.</p>
<p class="p1">As I have learned over the years in speaking with seasoned funeral service professionals and the Worsham College of Mortuary Science students, I teach the path to funeral service, which has not always been a direct path for many. This is undoubtedly true for Derrick. Derrick&#8217;s journey began with a pivotal conversation with his friend Joe Kalmer, who had transitioned from broadcasting to becoming a funeral director. Joe&#8217;s advice encouraged Derrick to explore trade embalming as a means to fund his forensics degree. This decision led Derrick to Southern Illinois University&#8217;s Mortuary Science Program, where he discovered a profound passion for helping families through their most challenging times.</p>
<p class="p1">As Derrick&#8217;s career unfolded, he became involved with DMORT, a federal mortuary response team under the Department of Health and Human Services. DMORT specializes in assisting with mass fatality events by providing forensic and mortuary expertise. With ten teams across the United States, DMORT deploys when local and state resources are overwhelmed, offering critical support through their Disaster Portable Morgue Units and Victim Identification Centers. Derrick&#8217;s journey with DMORT began after volunteering with the National Funeral Directors Association (NFDA) in New York following the 9/11 attacks. Encouraged by DMORT members he met there, Derrick applied and underwent a rigorous selection process, including background checks and security clearances, to join the team.</p>
<p class="p1">Derrick&#8217;s role as a Mortuary Officer in DMORT requires him to be a licensed Funeral Director, and Embalmer is in good standing. Training is extensive, covering harassment prevention, blood borne pathogen safety, psychological first aid, and more. Annual training sessions, often self funded, prepare team members for various disaster scenarios, ranging from plane crashes to severe weather events.</p>
<p class="p1">During deployments, Derrick&#8217;s adaptability and dedication are evident. Every deployment is unique, with team members like Derrick tasked with diverse assignments—managing morgue operations, conducting forensic examinations, and even participating in reconnaissance missions with military forces. Derrick emphasizes the importance of professionalism and teamwork throughout each deployment, ensuring that every task is executed with precision and care.</p>
<p class="p1">Derrick was recently deployed to Asheville, North Carolina, following the devastation of Hurricane Helene. There, he was responsible for managing morgue operations, coordinating with local medical examiners, and strategizing with military search and recovery teams. Despite the challenging conditions, Derrick highlights the deep bonds formed among team members and the resilience of the local community.</p>
<p class="p1">I appreciate that Derrick mentioned the Mercy Chefs organization, which provided warm, nourishing meals to responders and residents. Mercy Chefs is a wonderful non-profit, and I&#8217;ve had the opportunity to volunteer for when floods hit eastern Kentucky. Check them out if you like working in the kitchen and prefer short-term volunteer opportunities. <a href="https://mercychefs.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">www.mercychefs.com</a></p>
<p class="p1">The support provided by DMORT during such crises is crucial for families, offering a semblance of peace by facilitating the identification and release of deceased loved ones. Derrick&#8217;s work, while challenging, strengthens his faith in humanity and the power of compassion during times of tragedy. Learning more about this passion that drives DMORT to help others was genuinely touching.</p>
<p class="p1">The emotional demands of disaster response work are significant. Derrick and his team approach their mission with a steadfast mindset, understanding the critical role they play in facilitating families&#8217; grieving process. Derrick&#8217;s commitment to providing dignified and expedited support is a testament to his dedication and the essential nature of DMORT&#8217;s mission.</p>
<p class="p1">For those inspired by Derrick&#8217;s journey and considering a path in disaster response, Derrick emphasizes the importance of the passion to serve. The work requires mental and physical resilience, adaptability, and an unwavering commitment to the mission. Aspiring DMORT members are encouraged to explore state teams and stay informed about opportunities through platforms like <a href="https://www.usajobs.gov/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">USAJOBS.GOV</a>.</p>
<p class="p1">Derrick&#8217;s journey inspires others to embrace the call to serve, highlighting the vital role that DMORT plays in disaster response and the healing process for grieving families. Johnson Consulting Group is proud of Derrick&#8217;s work, which not only aids those in need but also inspires a new generation to follow in his footsteps, serving with dignity and compassion in times of tragedy.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Budget Success in 2025" width="1080" height="608" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Ec9_iWJD1oI?feature=oembed"  allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I had the pleasure of hosting a Johnson Consulting Conversations featuring Nelson Thulin, our Director of Business Consulting. We dived into the topic of funeral home budget success for 2025, during which Nelson provided valuable insights and strategies to help funeral providers thrive in a competitive market and plan accordingly for 2025.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Nelson emphasized the importance of analyzing historical and year-to-date data as a foundational aspect of budgeting and understanding where your funeral home&#8217;s sales trend is crucial for projecting future activity. He advised being honest and realistic when examining past data, as it forms the basis for planning and growth.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Nelson highlighted the shift from traditional burial to cremation services, with an increase in direct cremation and memorial services. Being as detailed as possible with the data is the key, and understanding there is a difference between sustaining growth and sustaining a steady call volume.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>With projections, Nelson discussed the impact of external factors such as market competition and advertising efforts. Recognizing new competitors&#8217; emergence and marketing strategies is vital for staying ahead. He mentioned that new funeral home owners strongly engage in community outreach often, influencing the local market dynamics, and that can have an impact on other area funeral homes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Adjusting pricing can significantly affect sales projections, and Nelson stressed the importance of understanding how these changes influence average sales per call. He also addressed labor expenses, advising owners to consider salaries, overtime, training, and benefits as part of their 2024 budgeting. Nelson recommended viewing training as an investment, not an expense. And, of course, we both agreed that access to performance data from <a href="https://www.johnsonconsulting.com/services/performance-tracker-x/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Performance Tracker X</a> can help customize training content.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We discussed regularly reviewing and maintaining facilities. He advised being brutally honest about facility upkeep, from carpets to wall repairs. Hiring a mystery shopper to evaluate the premises during non-busy times can provide an unbiased perspective on the facility&#8217;s image.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Vehicle-related costs, including maintenance and insurance, are another significant expenditure. Nelson recommended carefully analyzing buying and leasing options. We also briefly discussed advertising and how being very intent and strategic can have a considerable impact, and funeral homes should prioritize advertising channels that yield the best return on investment.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Funeral home owners can confidently navigate financial planning with these insights, ensuring sustainable and successful operations. Watch the entire conversation above! Our next Johnson Consulting Conversation is December 11th at 2 PM EST.</p>

In tribute, the event has been renamed The Tom Johnson Memorial Classic.</p>

<p>The tournament attracted a full field of golfers from all across the profession. Over the three-day period, the event raised over $150,000 for educational initiatives within the funeral service profession. This year&#8217;s contributions set a new record, making it the most successful event in its history. Cumulatively, the tournament has raised over $1,250,000 for the funeral service profession.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Jake Johnson expressed his gratitude, stating, &#8220;I am overwhelmed by the generosity shown this year. My father would be incredibly proud of the contributions made in his honor.&#8221;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Funds raised from the Memorial Classic are donated to the ICCFA Educational Foundation and the Funeral Service Foundation. A tribute video is always presented during the event honoring prior attendees in the funeral service profession who have passed away.

<p><strong>Scottsdale, AZ [October 5th, 2023]</strong></p>
<p>Today, ICCFA&#8217;s Educational Foundation proudly reveals that it has been generously endowed with a $75,000 donation courtesy of the Memorial Classic Golf Tournament. For over four decades, this event, founded by Tom Johnson, has united friends in the funeral service community in the spirit of camaraderie and fellowship. With an impressive annual turnout, the tournament has evolved into a powerful philanthropic endeavor, dedicated to giving back to the funeral service profession.</p>
<p>Over the past eleven years, the Memorial Classic Golf Tournament has exemplified its commitment by contributing more than $475,000 to the ICCFA Educational Foundation. Gino Merendino, President of the Educational Foundation,  stated, “The annual support we receive from the Memorial Classic Golf Tournament enables the Educational Foundation to fulfill our charter and make educational opportunities accessible to all ICCFA members. We are thankful and honored to have such committed donors that share the vision to give back to the profession in such a positive way.”</p>
<p>Led by Tom and Jake Johnson of Johnson Consulting Group, the annual Memorial Classic Golf Tournament, and the proceeds from that event, made it possible for the Educational Foundation to award more than 100 scholarships to the 2023 ICCFA University held at Emory University.</p>
<p>&#8220;As someone deeply dedicated to our profession, I&#8217;m excited to be a part of our ongoing effort to assist and guide those in the funeral industry,&#8221; shared Jake Johnson, President and CEO of Johnson Consulting Group.</p>
