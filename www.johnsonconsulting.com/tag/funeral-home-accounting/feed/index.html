<p>In our latest Johnson Consulting Conversations, we spoke with Suzanne Akre, Founder and CEO of Akre &amp; Associates and Akre Legacy Recruiting. With over 30 years of recruiting experience, Suzanne shared valuable insights about recruiting in the funeral service profession.</p>
<p>Suzanne never set out to recruit for funeral service—it found her. About a decade ago, her firm began recruiting leaders for an organization serving the death care industry. As her network grew, she discovered that funeral homes, cemeteries, suppliers, and death-tech companies share a common challenge—finding qualified talent.</p>
<p>One challenge that Suzanne often encounters is funeral provider clients being able to give enough time to the hiring process.  She understands how busy a funeral owner or manager can be and is committed to keeping all parties involved updated.</p>
<p>In discussing missed opportunities for prospective candidates Suzanne mentioned that funeral directors rarely manage their brand, making traditional recruiting tools ineffective. Most don&#8217;t have a professional social media presence and are so dedicated to serving families that they don&#8217;t focus on their career growth. Even professionals desperate for change hesitate to take the first step. With that in mind Suzanne established<br />
www.akrelegacyrecruiting.com, creating a landing spot for both funeral providers and professionals seeking career changes.</p>
<p>Suzanne&#8217;s recruitment process begins with learning about the company&#8217;s culture, staff, role history, families served, compensation, growth opportunities, and onboarding. After securing an agreement, her team sources talent, facilitates interviews, and manages the entire process through to placement and beyond.</p>
<p>Timeframes for filling positions vary significantly but on average it takes three to six months to complete the process.  Factors affecting this timeline include geographic challenges, candidate response times, interview scheduling priorities, compensation packages, counteroffers, and relocation issues.</p>
<p>We discussed common mistakes that can be avoided. &#8220;Time kills deals!&#8221; Suzanne emphasized when identifying hiring mistakes. Taking too long to engage candidates, allowing toxic employees to participate in interviews, providing incomplete offer letters, assuming automatic trust, and conducting impersonal interviews are common pitfalls that cost funeral homes top talent.</p>
<p>It was interesting to hear Suzanne’s perspective on what today&#8217;s funeral service professionals seek in workplaces that value them personally and professionally. They want guilt-free PTO, mental well-being support, clear advancement paths, mentorship, and supportive leadership. When choosing employers, they prioritize compensation, location, culture, colleague attitudes, and relocation assistance.</p>
<p>Successful funeral homes build strong teams by offering competitive compensation, implementing thorough onboarding, treating employees exceptionally well, acknowledging community involvement, providing encouragement, and having owners who actively support their staff.</p>
<p>The next generation of funeral directors brings different expectations. Most weren&#8217;t born into this business and many experienced a personal death young, giving them a deep drive to help others. They expect fair pay, mentorship, career growth, mental health support, clear communication, and technology integration.</p>
<p>As an instructor at Worsham College of Mortuary Science, I&#8217;ve observed these shifting mindsets firsthand. Today&#8217;s students are passionate about serving families while seeking balance. They&#8217;re tech-savvy and ask more questions during interviews about schedules, mentorship, and growth opportunities.</p>
<p>We talked in depth about second-career professionals who do differ notably from new first-career graduates. As Suzanne perfectly stated, second-career professionals have &#8220;already done difficult things&#8221; and know their capacity for hard work. Many are drawn to funeral service by personal experiences and bring higher emotional intelligence with less fear of the field. It’s not uncommon for them to have held management positions.  It’s important to know they expect independence and seek leadership opportunities sooner.</p>
<p>Suzanne shared valuable advice for funeral service professionals wanting to stay competitive.  First, keep developing technology skills, work on public speaking abilities, update professional online profiles, leverage networking capabilities, and consider attending compassion cultivation training.</p>
<p>For mortuary students, Suzanne recommends building a professional brand, maintaining a professional social media presence, finding mentors, joining community organizations, developing healthy habits, and remembering their crucial role in guiding families through difficult times. In my Worsham College role, I emphasize that technical skills alone won&#8217;t guarantee success. The graduates who thrive combine interpersonal abilities, adaptability, and commitment to learning with their technical knowledge.</p>
<p>The insights from our conversation highlight the evolving landscape of funeral service recruiting. By focusing on culture, professional development, and adapting to today&#8217;s workforce expectations, funeral providers can succeed in an increasingly competitive market.

<p>Join us for our next conversation with Amanda Hill of Female Forward on April 9th, discussing how funeral providers can better market to female consumers.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Johnson Consulting Conversations: Insider Perspectives and Stories With Lacy Robinson's first topic, Funeral Homes and Hospices Working Together</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="From Cold Leads to Hot Leads   Strategies to Boost Your Lead Conversion Rates" width="1080" height="608" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_ESYVRdEYQc?feature=oembed"  allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p class="p1">January&#8217;s Johnson Consulting Conversation featured the incredibly insightful Jill Lazar, VP of Business Development at <a href="https://www.ringringmarketing.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ring Ring Marketing</a>. Jill shared proven strategies for connecting with potential clients, converting cold leads into hot leads, and how funeral providers can energize their approach to pre-need marketing.</p>
<p class="p1">We started with a key concept: the distinction between cold and hot leaders. Jill said to imagine cold leads as people who might be curious about pre-arranging their funeral but aren&#8217;t quite ready to commit. They&#8217;re like explorers, gathering information and weighing options. On the flip side, hot leads are prepared to dive in—they&#8217;ve decided to pre-arrange and are searching for the right partner to help them. The magic lies in transforming those curious explorers into committed clients. This transformation is no small feat and demands a dynamic blend of traditional wisdom and <a href="https://www.johnsonconsulting.com/services/performance-tracker-x/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cutting-edge funeral home technology</a>.</p>
<p class="p1">We know that community outreach is the heartbeat of connection. It&#8217;s where the real excitement happens for making meaningful connections in the community. Jill and I discussed how funeral homes can become trusted advisors in their communities by engaging in genuine outreach. Jill suggested hosting engaging events like movie nights for Veterans or an informative seminar on Veteran death benefits. Events like this cost trust and familiarity. The secret sauce is focusing on relationships, not sales pitches. It&#8217;s about being a trusted friend, not just another business.</p>
<p class="p1">In our fast-paced digital age, you might think direct mail has gone the way of the dinosaurs. Jill shared that direct mail is still a powerhouse. Sending a physical mailer often leads to warmer client interactions than digital alternatives. Why? Because receiving and responding to mail requires a level of commitment that clicks and likes simply don&#8217;t capture. Combining direct mail with social media for events can bring in similar numbers of leads, but the mail leads often close with more success. It&#8217;s all about finding that sweet spot between tradition and innovation.</p>
<p class="p1">Jill and I discussed personalization in marketing, which is more than a trend; it&#8217;s a necessity. Jill stressed that it&#8217;s about making every potential client feel recognized and valued. Recommendations from Jill included using videos and staff photos in marketing materials to send personalized video messages. There are endless ways to make connections feel personal and genuine. The goal is to have potential clients walk through the funeral home doors feeling like they already know you.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Last year Jill posted a video on LinkedIn showing off her cat on National Cat Day. That video turned out to be her most viewed video because it was personal, genuine and it included a pet which was a suggestion from her co-worker.</p>
<p class="p1">Every community is unique, with its own culture and preferences. One size definitely doesn&#8217;t fit all in funeral service marketing. Jill stated that success depends on knowing your audience and tailoring your messages to meet their specific needs. This approach addresses natural sales resistance and positions the funeral director or pre-need consultant as a compassionate advisor. By doing so, you build lasting relationships based on understanding and empathy.</p>
<p class="p1">We know that technology is revolutionizing nearly all industries and different types of businesses. One fascinating idea we explored was the concept of an &#8220;empty cart&#8221; feature on <a href="https://www.johnsonconsulting.com/funeral-home-website-needs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">funeral home websites</a>. People can plan their end-of-life services online, just like shopping on Amazon. This tool provides valuable insights into client preferences. We must remember that technology is only as effective as the people behind it. Ensure your team is well-trained and enthusiastic about using these tools for the best results. Jill mentioned the opportunities that exist when an online consumer has a full shopping cart but doesn&#8217;t check out.</p>
<p class="p1">Patience is a virtue, especially when measuring marketing success in funeral service. Jill advocates for a 12-month evaluation period—pre-need marketing programs often reveal their true potential over time. This patient approach helps avoid hasty judgments and allows strategies to flourish fully.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Balancing tradition with innovation will be crucial for a <a href="https://www.johnsonconsulting.com/enhance-funeral-preneed-sales/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">funeral provider&#8217;s pre-need success</a>. It&#8217;s not about choosing between old and new—it&#8217;s about discovering the perfect blend that resonates with your community.</p>
<p class="p1">Thank you, Jill, for joining us on Johnson Consulting Conversations! Below is the recording in case you missed it live. Be sure to watch the surprise at the end for her and Welton Hong, Founder of Ring Ring Marketing.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The funeral profession has long provided avenues for entrepreneurship, and now, more than ever, the opportunities to become your own boss are growing. <a href="https://nfda.org/news/in-the-news/nfda-news/id/8215/plan-for-prosperity-with-foresight-and-johnson-consulting" target="_blank" rel="noopener">According to recent National Funeral Directors Association (NFDA) statistics</a>, there will be a significant number of funeral home ownership transfers within the next five years. With approximately 18,000 funeral homes in the U.S., and 80% of those handling 100 or fewer calls annually, many current owners are facing succession. This creates a prime opportunity for funeral directors to step up and become business owners.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, the allure of ownership should be approached with careful consideration. While the idea of having the freedom to set your own schedule and make decisions without supervision is appealing, there are inherent challenges. Being a good funeral director doesn’t necessarily equate to being a good manager, and similarly, good managers don’t always make good owners. It&#8217;s critical to recognize personal inadequacies and work on developing the skills necessary to succeed as an owner.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://funeraldirectordaily.com/going-into-business-on-your-own/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">As Tom noted in his article</a>, the journey from funeral director to owner requires a deep understanding of what ownership entails. It’s easy to look at the rewards of owning a business without fully appreciating the hard work required to reach that level. The climb to the top involves a great deal of learning, adaptation, and a willingness to let go of certain tasks in order to assume the broader responsibilities of ownership.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When exploring funeral home ownership opportunities, it&#8217;s advisable to memorialize any promises of future ownership in writing with a current owner. Without a formal agreement, there is little foundation to build on, and years of hard work might not result in an ownership stake. Aspiring owners should also be prepared to enhance their leadership and management skills through conferences and training programs, such as those offered by <a href="https://www.johnsonconsulting.com/services/jcg-academy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Johnson Consulting Group’s Leadership and Management Academies</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>One of the current advantages in our profession is the availability of financing. With the right preparation, a bank can fund the purchase of a funeral home, allowing the new owner to pay back a loan over time while keeping the business for themselves. This is a key part of the American dream, but it requires thorough financial readiness, both in terms of savings and skill set. Aspiring owners must be equipped to manage debt and know when and where to seek assistance.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It’s important to remember that the learning process never stops. As an owner, others will look to you for answers, which can create pressure. But, it’s crucial to continue growing and seeking support when needed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Looking at the next generation, there’s often a misconception that “They won’t work as hard as previous generations”. However, today’s business professionals are finding innovative ways to balance work and life. Through outsourcing, leveraging resources like associations and the internet, and using study groups, younger professionals are finding efficient ways to accomplish their goals without overworking themselves. In summary, it’s more about prioritizing balance and using the abundant resources available.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In conclusion, owning and running a funeral business isn’t for everyone, but it can be incredibly rewarding. The key to success lies in taking care of the families you serve…Period! If you can do that, they will take care of you. With the right preparation, support, and willingness to learn, you can enjoy the many benefits of ownership and establish a successful future for you and your family.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In the funeral service profession, financial control is the cornerstone of a sustainable and profitable business. At Johnson Consulting Group, we understand the unique challenges funeral home owners face, from regulatory compliance to managing sensitive customer relations. Mastering financial control ensures your business not only survives but thrives in this compassionate yet competitive field. This article will help you craft a strategic financial plan and implement key strategies to sustain your business.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>Crafting a Strategic Financial Plan for Funeral Homes</strong></h2>
<p>Developing a robust business plan is the first step toward financial mastery in the funeral service profession. This plan serves as a roadmap, guiding your funeral home through budgeting, forecasting, and cash flow management. A well-crafted business plan showcases the viability and strategic vision of your funeral home.</p>
<h3><strong>Key Elements of a Financial Plan:</strong></h3>
<ol>
<li><strong>Budgeting and Forecasting</strong>: Establish clear financial goals and projections to guide your business decisions.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.johnsonconsulting.com/funeral-home-cash-flow-management/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Cash Flow Management</strong></a>: Maintain a steady cash flow to ensure operational efficiency and sustainability. Consider using a thirteen-week cash flow analysis provided on a weekly basis.</li>
</ol>
<p>Understanding a comprehensive financial strategy will enable your funeral home to provide essential services while maintaining financial health.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>Balancing Empathy with Economics in Funeral Service</strong></h2>
<p>Funeral home owners face the delicate task of blending empathy with economic viability. Financial control is crucial in balancing these elements, ensuring that pricing structures are fair and transparent while supporting your business&#8217;s profitability.</p>
<h3><strong>Strategies for Balancing Empathy with Economics:</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Transparent Pricing</strong>: A key consideration would be placing your prices on your website. Also, utilizing phone shopping vendors to ensure you are not only in compliance but providing all options to families guarantees your transparency and compliance.</li>
<li><strong>Cost Management</strong>: Control expenses on essentials like caskets and services to keep operations efficient and families happy.</li>
<li><strong>Revenue Tracking</strong>: A detailed sales contract analysis ensures that you know exactly what the average sales are per case type along with the averages of the items sold within those calls. This ensures that your pricing is not only competitive, but that you&#8217;re recovering your pricing as a correlation to the average sale you&#8217;re receiving.</li>
</ul>
<p>By combining compassionate care with sound financial strategies, you can offer meaningful services while maintaining a viable business model.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>Sustaining Your Funeral Home Business</strong></h2>
<p>Effective financial control is key to sustaining a funeral service business. Strategic planning helps you adapt to market changes while honoring the emotional aspects of our profession.</p>
<h3><strong>Key Financial Strategies for Sustainability:</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Budgeting</strong>: Predictable costs ensure affordability for clients and stability for your business.</li>
<li><a href="https://files.constantcontact.com/d90f336d001/f097c1e4-7b76-427c-b3a9-2a56c1c1315b.pdf?rdr=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Financial Forecasting</strong></a>: Prepare for industry trends and future demands in your market.</li>
<li><strong>Investment in Staff Training</strong>: Enhance service quality and succession planning which fosters client trust and loyalty.</li>
</ul>
<p>A well-structured financial plan empowers your funeral home to meet customer needs with integrity, ensuring both dignified services and business longevity.</p>
<p>In Conclusion, crafting a strategic financial plan is the foundation of a thriving funeral service business. By focusing on budgeting, cash flow management, and balancing empathy with economics, funeral home owners can sustain their operations and serve their communities effectively.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p1">In the most recent Johnson Consulting Conversation, I introduced <a href="https://www.johnsonconsulting.com/about/our-team/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Derrick Hussman</a>, Senior Business Consultant for Johnson Consulting Group and a dedicated member of the Disaster Mortuary Operational Response Team (DMORT). Derrick&#8217;s journey in the funeral service industry is as captivating as it is inspiring. From considering a career in broadcasting to finding his calling in forensics and funeral service, Derrick&#8217;s path is a testament to the power of guidance, passion, and willingness to serve.</p>
<p class="p1">As I have learned over the years in speaking with seasoned funeral service professionals and the Worsham College of Mortuary Science students, I teach the path to funeral service, which has not always been a direct path for many. This is undoubtedly true for Derrick. Derrick&#8217;s journey began with a pivotal conversation with his friend Joe Kalmer, who had transitioned from broadcasting to becoming a funeral director. Joe&#8217;s advice encouraged Derrick to explore trade embalming as a means to fund his forensics degree. This decision led Derrick to Southern Illinois University&#8217;s Mortuary Science Program, where he discovered a profound passion for helping families through their most challenging times.</p>
<p class="p1">As Derrick&#8217;s career unfolded, he became involved with DMORT, a federal mortuary response team under the Department of Health and Human Services. DMORT specializes in assisting with mass fatality events by providing forensic and mortuary expertise. With ten teams across the United States, DMORT deploys when local and state resources are overwhelmed, offering critical support through their Disaster Portable Morgue Units and Victim Identification Centers. Derrick&#8217;s journey with DMORT began after volunteering with the National Funeral Directors Association (NFDA) in New York following the 9/11 attacks. Encouraged by DMORT members he met there, Derrick applied and underwent a rigorous selection process, including background checks and security clearances, to join the team.</p>
<p class="p1">Derrick&#8217;s role as a Mortuary Officer in DMORT requires him to be a licensed Funeral Director, and Embalmer is in good standing. Training is extensive, covering harassment prevention, blood borne pathogen safety, psychological first aid, and more. Annual training sessions, often self funded, prepare team members for various disaster scenarios, ranging from plane crashes to severe weather events.</p>
<p class="p1">During deployments, Derrick&#8217;s adaptability and dedication are evident. Every deployment is unique, with team members like Derrick tasked with diverse assignments—managing morgue operations, conducting forensic examinations, and even participating in reconnaissance missions with military forces. Derrick emphasizes the importance of professionalism and teamwork throughout each deployment, ensuring that every task is executed with precision and care.</p>
<p class="p1">Derrick was recently deployed to Asheville, North Carolina, following the devastation of Hurricane Helene. There, he was responsible for managing morgue operations, coordinating with local medical examiners, and strategizing with military search and recovery teams. Despite the challenging conditions, Derrick highlights the deep bonds formed among team members and the resilience of the local community.</p>
<p class="p1">I appreciate that Derrick mentioned the Mercy Chefs organization, which provided warm, nourishing meals to responders and residents. Mercy Chefs is a wonderful non-profit, and I&#8217;ve had the opportunity to volunteer for when floods hit eastern Kentucky. Check them out if you like working in the kitchen and prefer short-term volunteer opportunities. <a href="https://mercychefs.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">www.mercychefs.com</a></p>
<p class="p1">The support provided by DMORT during such crises is crucial for families, offering a semblance of peace by facilitating the identification and release of deceased loved ones. Derrick&#8217;s work, while challenging, strengthens his faith in humanity and the power of compassion during times of tragedy. Learning more about this passion that drives DMORT to help others was genuinely touching.</p>
<p class="p1">The emotional demands of disaster response work are significant. Derrick and his team approach their mission with a steadfast mindset, understanding the critical role they play in facilitating families&#8217; grieving process. Derrick&#8217;s commitment to providing dignified and expedited support is a testament to his dedication and the essential nature of DMORT&#8217;s mission.</p>
<p class="p1">For those inspired by Derrick&#8217;s journey and considering a path in disaster response, Derrick emphasizes the importance of the passion to serve. The work requires mental and physical resilience, adaptability, and an unwavering commitment to the mission. Aspiring DMORT members are encouraged to explore state teams and stay informed about opportunities through platforms like <a href="https://www.usajobs.gov/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">USAJOBS.GOV</a>.</p>
<p class="p1">Derrick&#8217;s journey inspires others to embrace the call to serve, highlighting the vital role that DMORT plays in disaster response and the healing process for grieving families. Johnson Consulting Group is proud of Derrick&#8217;s work, which not only aids those in need but also inspires a new generation to follow in his footsteps, serving with dignity and compassion in times of tragedy.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>With the <a href="https://windhambrannon.com/blog/tcja-sunsetting-tax-strategy-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA)</a> provisions set to expire at the end of 2025, business owners and individuals alike face significant tax changes. These changes will affect both personal and business finances. In this Q&amp;A with the Johnson Consulting Team, we’ll explore the major tax provisions expiring and the strategies business owners should consider as the sunset of the TCJA approaches.</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<h2><strong>Q: Which major tax provisions from the TCJA are set to expire at the end of 2025?</strong></h2>
<p>A: Individuals and families can expect tax increases, but for business owners, the most concerning provisions include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Loss of the Section 199A Deduction</strong>: This deduction, currently available to pass-through entities (such as S-corporations and LLCs), allows business owners to deduct up to 20% of qualified business income. When this expires, pass-through entities will lose a valuable tax-saving tool, potentially increasing the tax burden on small businesses and entrepreneurs.</li>
<li><strong>Loss of Caps on State and Local Tax (SALT) Deductions in High-Tax States</strong>: Taxpayers in states with high income and property taxes could face higher overall tax liabilities as the current $10,000 cap on state and local tax deductions disappears.</li>
<li><strong>Reversion of Capital Gains Tax Rates</strong>: Capital gains tax rates will revert to being determined by your regular income tax bracket. This means that individuals in higher income brackets may see a significant increase in their tax rate on long-term capital gains.</li>
<li><strong>Reduction in Estate and Gift Tax Exclusion</strong>: The current estate and gift tax exclusion of $12.92 million per individual will drop by nearly 50%, meaning estates valued over approximately $6 million will be subject to estate taxes. This change could affect many families planning to transfer wealth to the next generation, making estate planning a crucial step in the coming years.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<h2><strong>Q: What tax strategies should funeral home and cemetery business owners consider as 2025 approaches?</strong></h2>
<p>A: One key strategy is to consider accelerating your income before the TCJA provisions expire. With capital gains rates set to revert to higher levels based on your income tax bracket, now is an optimal time to sell assets, take profits, or increase distributions. By doing so, you can take advantage of the lower rates now, reducing your tax liability compared to what it would be under future tax rules.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This strategy is particularly beneficial for those with capital assets such as stocks, real estate, or business interests that have appreciated significantly over time. Locking in current capital gains rates could save you a substantial amount in taxes before the rates increase post-2025.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Other considerations may be to reevaluate your business structure, either converting it to a C-Corp or an S-Corp to lessen taxes. It may also be an opportunity to increase contributions to retirement plans, investing in capital equipment, or exploring tax-advantaged benefits for employees.</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<h2><strong>The Importance of Timing in Succession Planning</strong></h2>
<p>When it comes to succession planning, the timing of a sale can have a significant impact on the value you ultimately retain. In the words of Jake Johnson, &#8220;It&#8217;s not what you get, it&#8217;s what you keep.&#8221; Even though the sale price of a business may remain the same before and after 2025, the amount you keep after taxes will change. This is due to the potential tax increases that could arise when the TCJA provisions expire.</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<h2><strong>Q: How should funeral home and cemetery business owners approaching a succession plan think about the timing of a sale?</strong></h2>
<p>A: If you&#8217;re considering <a href="https://www.johnsonconsulting.com/services/sell-my-business/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">transferring your funeral home or cemetery business</a>, now may be the optimal time to maximize the value of your business. With the potential tax increases on the horizon, selling before the end of 2025 could result in you keeping more of the proceeds.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;It’s just food for thought and something business owners should be aware of,&#8221; Jake continued. &#8220;If you were planning to sell around 2025, the tax changes might push you to reconsider your timing. Even if you’re not quite ready to sell, it’s worth considering whether selling now could help you avoid a higher tax bill later.&#8221;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The core idea is that waiting until 2026 or 2027 could mean a larger tax burden, requiring your business to make up the difference in growth or additional calls on capital. By transferring before the end of 2025, you may be able to capture a more favorable tax position and keep more of the proceeds from the sale. However, it’s important to remember that not everyone will be ready to sell at that time, so planning ahead and discussing options with a tax advisor is crucial.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In conclusion, with the expiration of these TCJA provisions on the horizon, proactive tax and succession planning are essential, working closely with a financial advisor will help you craft the best strategies to minimize your tax burden.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I had the pleasure of hosting a Johnson Consulting Conversations featuring Nelson Thulin, our Director of Business Consulting. We dived into the topic of funeral home budget success for 2025, during which Nelson provided valuable insights and strategies to help funeral providers thrive in a competitive market and plan accordingly for 2025.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Nelson emphasized the importance of analyzing historical and year-to-date data as a foundational aspect of budgeting and understanding where your funeral home&#8217;s sales trend is crucial for projecting future activity. He advised being honest and realistic when examining past data, as it forms the basis for planning and growth.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Nelson highlighted the shift from traditional burial to cremation services, with an increase in direct cremation and memorial services. Being as detailed as possible with the data is the key, and understanding there is a difference between sustaining growth and sustaining a steady call volume.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>With projections, Nelson discussed the impact of external factors such as market competition and advertising efforts. Recognizing new competitors&#8217; emergence and marketing strategies is vital for staying ahead. He mentioned that new funeral home owners strongly engage in community outreach often, influencing the local market dynamics, and that can have an impact on other area funeral homes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Adjusting pricing can significantly affect sales projections, and Nelson stressed the importance of understanding how these changes influence average sales per call. He also addressed labor expenses, advising owners to consider salaries, overtime, training, and benefits as part of their 2024 budgeting. Nelson recommended viewing training as an investment, not an expense. And, of course, we both agreed that access to performance data from <a href="https://www.johnsonconsulting.com/services/performance-tracker-x/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Performance Tracker X</a> can help customize training content.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We discussed regularly reviewing and maintaining facilities. He advised being brutally honest about facility upkeep, from carpets to wall repairs. Hiring a mystery shopper to evaluate the premises during non-busy times can provide an unbiased perspective on the facility&#8217;s image.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Vehicle-related costs, including maintenance and insurance, are another significant expenditure. Nelson recommended carefully analyzing buying and leasing options. We also briefly discussed advertising and how being very intent and strategic can have a considerable impact, and funeral homes should prioritize advertising channels that yield the best return on investment.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Funeral home owners can confidently navigate financial planning with these insights, ensuring sustainable and successful operations. Watch the entire conversation above! Our next Johnson Consulting Conversation is December 11th at 2 PM EST.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>As Benjamin Franklin once said, “In this world, nothing is certain but death and taxes,” so if you’re looking to enter a profession, funeral homes (or accounting) might seem like a lucrative choice. </p>
<p>The post <a href="https://www.johnsonconsulting.com/funeral-home-cash-flow-management/">Mastering the Art of Cash Flow Management: A Blueprint for Funeral Home and Cemetery Businesses</a> appeared first on <a href="https://www.johnsonconsulting.com">Johnson Consulting Group</a>.</p>
]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>“Revenue is vanity, profit is sanity, cash is reality.” The value on your monthly bank statement is not enough information for you to operate your funeral home and cemetery business strategically. You may find yourself questioning why revenue recorded and the cash in the bank don’t align.</p>
<p>Maintaining a healthy cash flow is vital for the day-to-day operations, growth, and overall financial well-being of a business. A lack of understanding and transparency of your cash position hinders your ability for the flexibility needed to navigate challenges, seize opportunities, and create long-term value.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>Here’s a few things you should be considering when making money moves: </strong></h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>The Importance of Timely Collections</h3>
<p>In the funeral and cemetery profession, time is both a precious commodity and a critical factor in maintaining positive cash flow. The first step towards financial well-being involves encouraging families to reconcile charges prior to service. Collecting fees at the time of arrangement and at the time of services rendered is a crucial practice that ensures a steady influx of cash. This proactive approach not only establishes trust but also mitigates the need for delayed invoicing. Additionally, managing cash advances, which may include fees from third parties that require immediate payment, is important to prevent a domino effect, maintaining your ability to meet financial obligations, fostering growth opportunities, and safeguarding relationships.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Adjusting Inventory and Supply Purchases to Optimize Cash Flow</h3>
<p>Carefully managing inventory and supplies is another piece in the cash flow management puzzle. Conduct a comprehensive analysis of your funeral home and cemetery inventory and supplies to identify slow-moving items or those with low turnover rates. Fine-tuning your inventory and supply levels, especially for essential items such as caskets, urns and memorials, and other operational needs to match the demand helps <a href="https://lp.constantcontactpages.com/su/MRA6Qca" target="_blank" rel="noopener">avoid excess stockpiles</a>. This strategic adjustment not only prevents overstocking but also releases capital that can be redirected towards more meaningful investments in your funeral home or cemetery business.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Be Proactive, Not Reactive</h3>
<p>Proactive financial planning involves securing funding before you find yourself in a cash crunch. Establishing a line of credit or <a href="https://www.johnsonconsulting.com/funeral-business-loans-and-refinancing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">seeking business loans</a> when your financial position is strong provides a safety net for unforeseen challenges. That’s why we advocate for proactive financial planning, an approach that ensures your business is equipped with the resources it needs, precisely when it needs them. Whether you’re looking to expand your facilities, invest in technology, or simply strengthen your financial position, personalized financial solutions that are aligned with your business goals will ensure long-term success.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Reviewing Cost Structure Within Your Company</h3>
<p>A periodic review of your cost structure is essential for identifying areas where expenses can be trimmed without compromising on service quality. Conducting an in-depth cost analysis will help you optimize your cost structure, ensuring that every dollar spent contributes to the growth and sustainability of your business.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Maintaining Cash Reserves for Stability</h3>
<p>In a profession where the unexpected is a constant companion, maintaining cash reserves is a strategic imperative. Whether it’s handling sudden spikes in demand or navigating economic uncertainties, having a financial buffer provides stability and peace of mind. Developing robust cash reserve strategies ensures you’re prepared for whatever challenges may arise.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Embracing Technology for Financial Efficiency</h3>
<p>The integration of technology can revolutionize the financial efficiency of your funeral home and cemetery operations. From automated invoicing systems to cloud-based financial management platforms, technology streamlines processes, reduces errors, and enhances overall productivity. Leveraging technology solutions will elevate your financial management capabilities and empower you to make data-driven decisions that positively impact your cash flow.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Your Path to Financial Success Starts Here</h3>
<p>In the ever-evolving landscape of funeral home and cemetery businesses, mastering the art of cash flow management is non-negotiable. Johnson Consulting Group is your trusted partner on this journey, offering tailored solutions that align with the unique needs of your business.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To have a successful funeral home, you need to get your accounting in order. Through accurate and timely financial reporting, you can not only ensure that you’re ready for tax season, but you’ll also be able to create strategic initiatives for years to come. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tidy bookkeeping requires time and attention to detail, which is why many funeral homes choose to trust a </span><a href="https://www.johnsonconsulting.com/services/accounting-financial-management/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">funeral home accounting firm like Johnson Consulting Group</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to manage the details on their behalf. Here are some actionable strategies and best practices to help you build and refine your funeral home’s financial management.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">1. Be Timely</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A fundamental component of funeral home accounting is timeliness. The sooner you start your reporting, the sooner you can start building your backlog of financial data. From this data, you can then begin to recognize patterns in revenue and expenditures.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When you have the most up-to-date financial information at your fingertips, you can make more informed decisions. For example, if you hope to make a large purchase––an expansion, perhaps––it’s essential to know exactly where your business stands financially and </span><a href="https://www.johnsonconsulting.com/the-dos-and-donts-of-budgeting-and-strategic-pricing-initiatives/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">whether or not you have the necessary budget</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Timeliness will also help you cut down on errors and omissions. If you wait to document certain financial transactions, then you’ll be more likely to forget specific circumstances and details when you move to document them.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you have a small team that already wears many hats, timeliness may be a challenge. In order to keep your bookkeeping records on track, it may make sense to </span><a href="https://www.johnsonconsulting.com/investing-in-funeral-home-accounting-services/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">invest in an accounting firm</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that specializes in deathcare to take the task off your hands.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">2. Maintain Accurate Deposit Records</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition to logging all transactions in a timely manner, it is essential for funeral homes to maintain accurate deposit records. You’ll want to get into the habit of preparing a deposit immediately after a transaction is made and ensure these deposits are properly documented. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Doing so means accounting for every dollar of incoming revenue, where it&#8217;s from, and what it was for. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is especially important for funeral businesses that work with cash transactions, as it eliminates the chance of misplacing or forgetting to enter a cash transaction. Properly tracking your revenue sources in this manner will also help protect your funeral home from fraud. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">3. Categorize Expenses Consistently</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Categorizing expenses correctly is a necessity. When it comes to expenses, take the time to properly document, track, and categorize every transaction. If you haven’t already developed a clear category structure for your expenses (chart of accounts), then you’ll want to do so immediately. Include instructions for your team that help them to distinguish between similar categories. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This includes tracking all deposits, purchases for goods and services, fees, and any other associated costs. Regularly reviewing your transactions can also help prevent surprises when tax season rolls around. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">4. Don’t Overuse the “Miscellaneous” Category</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A common mistake made by many funeral homes is over-utilizing the “miscellaneous” category. While “miscellaneous” can be a helpful utility, depending on it too much can lead to inaccurate bookkeeping and tax filing processes. If you’re labeling everything as miscellaneous, then you’re creating financial opacity for yourself down the road, making it more difficult to analyze your expenditures, not to mention capitalize on tax deductions. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Instead, you’ll want to create precise and detailed categories for each type of expenses so that you can properly track them. This also eliminates the need to try and guess the details of a specific purchase or transaction if the receipt is lost or otherwise unavailable.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">5. Link your POS and Accounting Software</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In order to maintain a comprehensive and updated view of your records, it is important to link yourcase management system and accounting software. This way, you can minimize latency between your financial tracking and reporting, saving time and reducing the risk of errors from manual data entry. However, your ability to do this may depend on the technical limitations of your </span><a href="https://www.johnsonconsulting.com/purchasing-funeral-home-accounting-software/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">funeral home accounting software</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">6. Reconcile Receivables </span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Finally, to properly manage your cash flow, it is essential to ensure that all receivables are reconciled. This means that any incoming payments are properly accounted for and recorded in the appropriate place. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Doing so allows for easy tracking of all receivables and allows your management team to better identify and avoid potential collection issues.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To understand the financial health of your funeral business, the right advice is essential. One of the best ways to dig deeper than surface-level numbers like profit and loss statements is by hiring an accounting firm specializing in funeral home business operations. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In this guide, we’ll discuss funeral business accounting firms and how these professionals can help drive the strategic planning of your funeral home. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Do You Need an Accounting Firm for Your Funeral Business? </span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We’ve said before that </span><a href="https://www.johnsonconsulting.com/benefits-of-hiring-a-funeral-business-consultant/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">your time as an owner is worth $1,000 per hour</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. For ownership and management to make the best decisions financially, they must have meaningful financial statements with benchmarks related to their profession.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s for this reason that funeral business accounting firms can play an essential role in your success, helping your team prepare industry-specific financial statements, provide expense benchmark guidance, and conduct bookkeeping and business consulting services. This is true for any business, especially small or family-owned businesses that may not have the staffing or expertise to dedicate the proper time to bookkeeping.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That said, a run-of-the-mill accountant may not be the most effective choice for your funeral business. An accountant with death care expertise can help you develop sound business strategies, analyze financial information, and identify areas of improvement for your business. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Understand Your Funeral Business’s Financial Health </span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are many factors that make the funeral profession unique, and the right accounting firm will know how to navigate the right path through these ins and outs. They may even be able to help you </span><a href="https://www.johnsonconsulting.com/7-strategies-to-increase-your-funeral-homes-value-over-time/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">increase your funeral home’s value over time</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by analyzing your financials and providing guidance for growth. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An accountant that specializes in funeral business accounting will have the following unique attributes:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Has a funeral business-specific chart of accounts for properly categorizing revenue and expenses</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Has an appreciation for the value of monitoring case counts, case mix, and average sales per case</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Has knowledge in reconciling and exporting out of the various case management and point-of-sale systems available to the funeral professional</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Understands the </span><a href="https://www.johnsonconsulting.com/why-its-important-to-do-a-monthly-health-check-on-your-funeral-homes-financials/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">expense and revenue benchmarks</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and percentages attributable to successful funeral homes and cemeteries </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Knows how to construct the accounting process and reporting as a management tool with guidance rather than simply just reconciling to </span><a href="https://www.johnsonconsulting.com/funeral-home-taxes/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">prepare for taxes</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> at the end of the year</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Accountants who are experienced in the funeral and cemetery profession will be better suited for providing </span><a href="https://www.johnsonconsulting.com/what-goes-into-a-funeral-home-valuation/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">valuation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and consulting guidance specific to the funeral business, unlike normal accountants.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When the time comes to </span><a href="https://www.johnsonconsulting.com/when-is-it-the-right-time-to-put-my-funeral-home-for-sale/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">sell your funeral business</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, having an experienced accountant on your team is crucial for preparing an accurate business valuation and </span><a href="https://www.johnsonconsulting.com/funeral-businesses-sale-top-ways-owners-lose-money/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">getting the most from your sale</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
