										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>What is quiet quitting?</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’re keeping up with the world of business news, there’s no doubt you’ve heard about <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/money/2022/09/13/1122059402/the-economics-behind-quiet-quitting-and-what-we-should-call-it-instead" target="_blank" rel="noopener">quiet quitting</a>. It’s a new buzz term that strikes fear in the hearts of business owners and managers, but once you take a look at the idea, it’s clear that it’s really about a healthy work/life balance and being able to work at work without feeling a 24/7 connection to the job.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Perhaps the best way to put quiet quitting worries to rest is to create a workplace where staff feels comfortable and valued during their working hours. Incentive plans, trust, and an opportunity for career growth are great ways to help your <a href="https://www.johnsonconsulting.com/5-ways-to-keep-quality-talent-in-your-funeral-home/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">funeral business staff</a> feel valued.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>How to improve workplace relations:</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the best ways, according to <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/adriangostick/2022/08/23/5-ways-to-combat-quiet-quitting/?sh=252fcf144c49">Forbes</a>, to improve workplace relations and take quiet quitting off the table is to lead by example. Honor your own work/life boundaries as well as those of your staff. Show them that work stays at work by abiding by the same ideology yourself. It will improve anxiety and give you and your staff the time they need to rest and be the most productive versions of themselves during work hours.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The article also serves as a reminder that it’s okay to rethink what the workplace should look like from time to time. Just because this is the way it’s always been done, doesn’t mean it needs to stay that way. Speak openly with your staff about their needs and what is important to them at the workplace. This doesn’t mean you need to change everything or accept every bit of information provided but showing an openness to listening and implementing reasonable change goes a long way with people.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://www.johnsonconsulting.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Johnson Consulting Group</a> can help with this through business consulting services and leadership and management courses.
