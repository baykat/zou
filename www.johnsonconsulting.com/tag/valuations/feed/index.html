										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Questions to ask yourself as a business owner:</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As we near the end of the calendar year, you might be thinking about the status of your business. Are you growing in the ways you had hoped? Are you meeting or exceeding goals? Is your staff aligned with the goals you’ve set? These are just some questions to consider when you are assessing the growth of your business. Keep reading to learn some methods of growing and building value.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Methods of growing and building value:</h2>
<h3><b>Reviewing your business plan:</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Start by taking some time to review your business plan. If you don’t have one, it’s time to create one. The </span><a href="https://www.johnsonconsulting.com/your-business-lifecycle/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">business lifecycle</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is always on our mind at Johnson Consulting Group and evaluating your plan as you go is a great way to see if you are meeting the growth goals that will take your business to the next level. You might be surprised by what you find. It’s possible you could see a specific area of your business taking the lead, an indication you should put focus there. Taking the next step of an in depth <a href="https://www.johnsonconsulting.com/neglecting-a-swot-analysis-dont-do-it-heres-why/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SWOT analysis</a> for your </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">funeral business</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> could lead you to the right growth opportunities at the right time.</span></p>
<h3></h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>In sync staff:</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Having a staff that is truly in sync with your business goals is another key to growth. There are tactics you can implement to help your team feel connected to the success of your business such as incentive programs. Another way to take a broad look at overall success is with</span><a href="https://www.johnsonconsulting.com/services/performance-tracker-x/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Performance Tracker X</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. This service allows you to hear directly from your families on a variety of customizable metrics that may impact your growth. It’s a great way to balance sales with the compassion and sensitive needs of your customers.</span></p>
<h3></h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Mindset:</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We’ve touched on some of the more concrete, analytic things that are important to business growth, so let’s turn to some ideas that are a little more intangible. Bringing a positive mindset with you each day is very important. This article from </span><a href="https://www.entrepreneur.com/living/positive-thinking-will-change-your-life-and-business/432740" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Entrepreneur</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> expands on the idea that thinking positively when it comes to yourself and your business can have a big impact on those around you as well as on the ultimate success of your business.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even if you don&#8217;t plan to sell your funeral home or cemetery in the near future, obtaining yearly valuations offers powerful insight into the health of your business. A valuation provides you with the baseline knowledge of how much your business is worth and can be a way to monitor and manage its growth.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That said, not all valuations are created equally. For funeral businesses, a proper valuation requires a variety of considerations, including your management, capital structure, and future earnings prospects. Your debt, cash, and A/R are also key components when determining the net value of your business.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Most Common Method of Valuation in the Funeral Profession</span></h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">EBITDA Multiplier</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The EBITDA multiplier method takes your EBITDA (Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization) and multiplies it by a variable specific to the industry. For average to larger funeral homes in today’s market, this ranges from 6x to 7x and much higher for prized firms when the real estate is included.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Components Considered During a Valuation</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When determining the value of a funeral business, a valuation expert will consider several key components of the business. These include historical trends, labor, and tangible assets.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Historical Trends</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is critical to review the probability for performance for a new owner.  Multiple years of financial data are analyzed side by side to determine the likely outcome/budget/proforma.  One time expense items and owner related expenses are reviewed in great detail.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Labor</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There’s nothing more costly in an organization than it’s payroll.  And with recent trends we are seeing payroll increased by 5-8% of net sales over prior years.  This section requires a very detailed analysis.  It will consider what the payroll would need to look like if the ownership is no longer there.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tangible Assets</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Every funeral business has buildings, equipment, inventory, receivables, cash, and the list goes on.  What stays?  What is not included.  The value of the real estate will be key in determining the most appropriate valuation method…Will it include the real estate or will the real estate have to be leased?&#8230;How will that impact the value?</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Why an Annual Valuation Is Necessary</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Beyond the possibility of selling your business, an </span><a href="https://www.johnsonconsulting.com/consistent-funeral-home-valuation-important/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">annual valuation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> provides the information you need to understand your current positioning and plan for the future. Will you like the result? Will it impact your retirement? What do you need to live off of? How will you know?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By obtaining an annual valuation, you&#8217;ll:</span><b></b></p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1"><b>Deeply understand your finances: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">If your finances are currently in disarray, a valuation will force you to work with an accountant and organize your key financial metrics. Most importantly, you&#8217;ll be able to see your business&#8217;s profitability.</span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1"><b>Set realistic goals: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once you&#8217;ve obtained a valuation, you&#8217;ll understand how your business is currently performing, which will be an essential baseline to your planning. If your business is performing well, you can then plan for potential expansion. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Alternatively, you can create initiatives to turn things around if it&#8217;s underperforming. </span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1"><b>Plan for your exit: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">No matter how near or far, </span><a href="https://www.johnsonconsulting.com/plan-exit-strategy/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">all funeral businesses will eventually be sold</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> — that is, unless you plan to live forever. By obtaining regular valuations, you&#8217;ll be able to anticipate your gains (or losses) in the event of a sale, then plan your subsequent ventures accordingly. </span></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Make the Most of Your Data</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While simple forms of valuation can be performed on your own, the only surefire way to gain a realistic picture of your funeral home&#8217;s health is through a professional valuation performed by an accountant or industry experts such as Johnson Consulting Group. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At </span><a href="https://www.johnsonconsulting.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Johnson Consulting Group</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, our team of death care experts have performed thousands of valuations of funeral businesses of all stages and sizes.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">More than a prerequisite for selling your funeral home, a valuation is an essential component of understanding where your business stands. By taking the time to analyze your funeral home’s position in the marketplace, you can more effectively plan for the future, making strategic adjustments that set your funeral home on the path to success. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Still, a valuation is just data, albeit a complex and thorough sequence of data. What matters most is how you leverage this data to optimize the operations of your funeral home. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here’s where you can start.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Create a SWOT Analysis </span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Used by businesses across a variety of industries,  a </span><a href="https://www.johnsonconsulting.com/neglecting-a-swot-analysis-dont-do-it-heres-why/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">SWOT analyses</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> provides you with a top-level view of your company’s market positioning and consists of examining four pieces of internal and external data:</span><b></b></p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1"><b>Strengths: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">This refers to anything your funeral home currently excels at. This could be  a loyal customer base, unique services not offered by competitors, or even a high valuation. </span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1"><b>Weaknesses: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Weaknesses refer to internal factors that currently hinder your performance. For funeral homes, this might include high employee turnover, high levels of debt, or a low valuation. </span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1"><b>Opportunities: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Opportunities refer to favorable external factors that may benefit your business. For example, a growing population would present an opportunity. </span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><b>Threats: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Conversely, threats represent external factors that could serve to harm your business. For many funeral businesses, a declining interest in traditional burials has presented a threat. </span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A professional, in-depth SWOT analysis can take months to complete; however, by taking the time to brainstorm the SWOT categories with your team, you can quickly identify areas to focus on, whether this means addressing a threat or seizing upon an opportunity.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Make Operational Adjustments</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A valuation is an unbiased, quantitative look at what your funeral home is worth, and the results may be much lower than what you desire. In these cases, a valuation presents the hard truths, allowing you to look at core areas in need of attention. These may include:</span><b></b></p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1"><a href="https://www.johnsonconsulting.com/increase-your-preneed-sales-with-these-7-tips/"><b>Preneed sales</b></a><b>: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Few strategies will increase the value of your funeral home as much as fleshing out your preneed backlog. By selling pre-arranged services, you’ll not only get some immediate cash flow, but you’ll also ensure continued business in the future.</span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1"><a href="https://www.johnsonconsulting.com/remodels-that-wont-break-the-bank/"><b>Funeral home aesthetics</b></a><b>: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Depending on the scope of the project, renovations can be costly and time-consuming. However, replacing outdated lighting fixtures, carpeting, and finishes can be a budget-friendly way to increase the value of your funeral home and appeal to more families. </span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1"><b>Accounting: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">A </span><a href="https://www.johnsonconsulting.com/purchasing-funeral-home-accounting-software/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">dedicated </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">accounting manager can help you examine expense management across your funeral home. By figuring out where most of your expenses go and where most of your revenue comes from, you can more effectively understand how your funeral home produces value.</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><b>Service offerings: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you notice a growing market interest in innovative services like virtual memorials or green burials, then it might be time to </span><a href="https://www.johnsonconsulting.com/6565-2/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">expand your services</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></span></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reevaluate Your Goals</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you plan to expand your funeral business, refinance loans, or sell your business––in the near or distant future––the results of an evaluation will prove integral to </span><a href="https://www.johnsonconsulting.com/consistent-funeral-home-valuation-important/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">planning your next steps</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. For example, an exceptionally high valuation, combined with optimal market conditions, might make you consider selling your business earlier than expected. Conversely, a lower valuation may indicate that you’ll need to execute some strategic initiatives before selling. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">No matter how long you plan to own your funeral business, it’s important to remember that you’ll likely have to sell it or pass it on to the next generation. Because of this, from the day you begin operating your business, you’ll want to have an exit strategy, however loosely defined. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As the years go by, annual valuations will serve as a key benchmark of success for your funeral home, allowing you to track your progress in relation to your eventual exit.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Right Direction</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Annual valuations function like a yearly check-up for your funeral home, providing the quantitative data needed to measure the progress toward your business goals––whether this is to increase value for a sale or pass the business down to a family member. Conducting a valuation, however, is more than simply adding up revenue and assets. To conduct a professional, unbiased evaluation of your funeral home, you’ll need the help of accounting and financial management professionals. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At </span><a href="https://www.johnsonconsulting.com/services/accounting-financial-management/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Johnson Consulting Group</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, our team of experts has the death care experience and resources to establish exactly how much your business is worth.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Do you know how much your funeral or cemetery business is worth? A business valuation is the best way to answer this all-encompassing question. The valuation can be used for many purposes such as determining your baseline value, estate planning, succession planning and more. A professional valuation typically involves an in-depth analysis of various economic and financial factors to determine the true value of your business. The valuation process can be described as both an art and science, but the final product is invaluable.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As a funeral home or cemetery business owner, it might seem like a complicated and time-consuming exercise to invest in a professional business valuation on an annual basis. However, the results are well-worth the time and effort involved, and can help define a clear path towards growth and profitability for your company.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Johnson Consulting has helped thousands of funeral home and cemetery professionals achieve success, and we firmly believe that an annual business valuation is usually the first step towards driving positive results and improving your company’s competitive position. Here are our Top 5 reasons why you should get a business valuation every year:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>Enhance Strategic Planning</strong></h2>
<p>Strategic planning is an integral part of effective business management and is especially important to the long-term viability of funeral and cemetery companies. Using estimates or relying on “gut feelings” can lead to costly operational missteps — a professional valuation provides real-time data and analysis to help you establish a business strategy and determine what operational actions are necessary to achieve your goals.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>Maximize Sale Potential </strong></h2>
<p>Having a clear understanding of what your funeral or cemetery business is worth is crucial to evaluating sale options. Not only does a business valuation compare your firm to local competitors, it also reveals your position in comparison to the overall industry standings (utilizing benchmarks for expense accounts on your financial statements). Understanding where the profitability of your business falls, as compared to other operations, can assist in determining where improvements can be made now that will assist in maximizing your value when you’re ready to sell. This knowledge allows you to accurately assess potential purchase offers and maximize your bargaining power.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>Attract Investment</strong></h2>
<p>Potential investors need to know how much your company is worth before they put any money into it, and a professional valuation offers an objective determination of where to put their investment dollars. In addition, if your strategic plan requires outside financing, you will need a current evaluation to demonstrate the financial health of your funeral/cemetery business.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong> </strong><strong>Succession Planning</strong></h2>
<p>Many funeral and cemetery businesses are passed down to family members or company employees, which can be a major challenge for both the seller and the buyer. A business valuation provides a clear value range that is fair to both parties, allowing the family members to determine a win-win situation moving forward. When the true value of the business is pre-established, it can help reduce conflict and assist with a smooth transition for all parties involved.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>Simplify Taxes</strong></h2>
<p>The IRS levies specific taxes for significant business events such as mergers and acquisitions or share distributions. The total tax amount often depends on a company’s valuation, so a comprehensive review based on current financials and market capital could result in a lower tax bill for your funeral or cemetery business.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
