<p><strong><u>Scottsdale, AZ –</u></strong>Johnson Consulting Group (JCG) announced the recipients of the <strong><em>JCG 2024 Excellence in Customer Service Awards, powered by J3Tech Solutions.</em></strong></p>

The Overall Performance Score is a calculation of eighteen independent questions that measure results in four areas: 1) Initial Contact, 2) Arranging Director, 3) Facilities and Vehicles, 4) Staff and Services Provided.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The JCG client funeral homes are divided into three categories based on call volume. Award recipients achieved the highest levels of customer satisfaction among the 576 funeral homes that were eligible in 2024.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.johnsonconsulting.com/services/performance-tracker-x/">JCG Performance Tracker X</a> tool provides funeral homes and cemeteries timely, accurate measurements of customer service and sale performance.  The software offers comprehensive reporting that shows business owners what they are doing well and identifies the areas that need fine-tuning and improvements.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Johnson Consulting Group started its customer survey program in 2008. This large amount of survey data has proven invaluable to providing insight into customer needs and satisfaction. The company attributes the program’s growth based on its ability to offer the program with no contract to sign, a low monthly cost, and accessibility to its management professionals for interpretation and usefulness of the reports.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“With the commoditization of products and services in our society, providing an exceptionally high level of customer service is critical to differentiating us from our competition. At the average sale of a funeral today, the loss of even one family can have material impacts on a business and its value. The answer to continual improvement is to survey our customers, ask the difficult questions, ask for a review online, and recover when there&#8217;s an issue”, says Jake Johnson, President and CEO of Johnson Consulting Group.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Providing outstanding customer service is a universal goal for businesses, but how do we truly know we’re meeting the mark? Assumptions are not enough. Instead, it requires a systematic approach to evaluate, analyze, and enhance the service we offer. Here’s a step-by-step guide to transforming your customer service process and driving continuous improvement.</p>
<h2><strong>1.The Service…Start with Self-Reflection</strong></h2>
<p>Before seeking external feedback, begin by assessing your current service delivery. This requires vulnerability—being open to recognizing shortcomings and embracing opportunities for growth. Evaluate your processes, interactions, and touchpoints. Where could improvements be made? Honest reflection sets the stage for meaningful progress.</p>
<h2><strong>2.Gather Client Feedback</strong></h2>
<p>Once you’ve acknowledged areas for improvement, the next step is to collect insights directly from your customers. <a href="https://youtu.be/UCbpHRqLhVg?si=IKAOcyZwlN-VMB4b" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Customer satisfaction surveys</a> are an excellent tool for this purpose. These can be distributed digitally (email), via text, or through traditional mail (paper).</p>
<p>Focus on these key areas:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>First Point of Contact</strong>: Often the lowest-rated section in surveys. Ask how the family’s initial interaction with your business felt and identify gaps.</li>
<li><strong>Arrangement Process</strong>: Gather feedback on the ease and efficiency of the arrangement process.  How did the arranger listen and provide the options?</li>
<li><strong>Facilities and Appearance</strong>: Evaluate impressions of your facilities, vehicles, and surroundings.  Have you provided a comfortable and quality environment for the customer.</li>
<li><strong>Service Experience</strong>: For those who utilized your service, dig deeper into their experience.</li>
</ul>
<p>Further questions should include perceptions of the overall value, how customers discovered you, their willingness to leave online reviews, and suggestions for additional services (lead generation).</p>
<h2><strong>3.Act on Feedback Quickly…Real Time Data</strong></h2>
<p>In the movie, “<em>The Godfather”</em>, bad news was expected to be delivered promptly! Similarly, receiving real-time data allows you to address issues immediately rather than letting them go unchecked.  <a href="https://www.johnsonconsulting.com/services/performance-tracker-x/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Johnson Consulting’s Performance Tracker System</a> allows you to leverage the latest technology, providing a rapid response to customer concerns.</p>
<h2><strong>4.Analyze the Data</strong></h2>
<p>Collecting feedback is only valuable if you analyze it effectively. Use robust reporting platforms to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Filter data by time frame, location, or region.</li>
<li>Identify trends and actionable insights.</li>
<li>Generate reports in real time for prompt decision-making.</li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>5.Deploy Actionable Improvements</strong></h2>
<p>With insights in hand, it’s time to implement changes. Review the data with your management team and assign tasks for execution. Ask:</p>
<ul>
<li>What improvements can we make?</li>
<li>Who will be responsible for these changes?</li>
<li>What is the timeline for implementation?</li>
</ul>
<p>Accountability and clear timelines ensure that your efforts translate into measurable results.</p>
<h2><strong>6.Invest in CX Performance Improvement</strong></h2>
<p>Customer experience (CX) isn’t a one-time fix; it requires ongoing commitment. Consider hosting <a href="https://www.johnsonconsulting.com/services/jcg-academy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Johnson Consulting’s CX performance improvement workshops</a> to bolster your service culture. John DiJulius’s book “<em><a href="https://thedijuliusgroup.com/product/the-customer-service-revolution/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Customer Service Revolution</a>”</em> is an excellent resource for understanding how to create a customer-first approach.</p>
<h2><strong>7.Generate Leads Through Exceptional Service</strong></h2>
<p>Satisfied customers naturally become ambassadors for your business. By prioritizing CX and deploying actionable improvements, you create raving fans who are eager to share their experiences. Encourage them to leave online reviews and share testimonials. This not only generates leads but also strengthens your reputation.</p>
<h2><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2>
<p>Customer service excellence is a continuous cycle. Start with honest self-assessment, gather and act on client feedback, analyze data, and implement changes. Invest in your team’s growth through CX workshops, and reap the rewards of lead generation from loyal, satisfied customers. Then, begin the process again to ensure ongoing improvement.</p>
<p>By following these steps, you’ll not only elevate your service standards but also foster a culture of excellence that drives lasting success.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The funeral profession has long provided avenues for entrepreneurship, and now, more than ever, the opportunities to become your own boss are growing. <a href="https://nfda.org/news/in-the-news/nfda-news/id/8215/plan-for-prosperity-with-foresight-and-johnson-consulting" target="_blank" rel="noopener">According to recent National Funeral Directors Association (NFDA) statistics</a>, there will be a significant number of funeral home ownership transfers within the next five years. With approximately 18,000 funeral homes in the U.S., and 80% of those handling 100 or fewer calls annually, many current owners are facing succession. This creates a prime opportunity for funeral directors to step up and become business owners.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, the allure of ownership should be approached with careful consideration. While the idea of having the freedom to set your own schedule and make decisions without supervision is appealing, there are inherent challenges. Being a good funeral director doesn’t necessarily equate to being a good manager, and similarly, good managers don’t always make good owners. It&#8217;s critical to recognize personal inadequacies and work on developing the skills necessary to succeed as an owner.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://funeraldirectordaily.com/going-into-business-on-your-own/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">As Tom noted in his article</a>, the journey from funeral director to owner requires a deep understanding of what ownership entails. It’s easy to look at the rewards of owning a business without fully appreciating the hard work required to reach that level. The climb to the top involves a great deal of learning, adaptation, and a willingness to let go of certain tasks in order to assume the broader responsibilities of ownership.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When exploring funeral home ownership opportunities, it&#8217;s advisable to memorialize any promises of future ownership in writing with a current owner. Without a formal agreement, there is little foundation to build on, and years of hard work might not result in an ownership stake. Aspiring owners should also be prepared to enhance their leadership and management skills through conferences and training programs, such as those offered by <a href="https://www.johnsonconsulting.com/services/jcg-academy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Johnson Consulting Group’s Leadership and Management Academies</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>One of the current advantages in our profession is the availability of financing. With the right preparation, a bank can fund the purchase of a funeral home, allowing the new owner to pay back a loan over time while keeping the business for themselves. This is a key part of the American dream, but it requires thorough financial readiness, both in terms of savings and skill set. Aspiring owners must be equipped to manage debt and know when and where to seek assistance.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It’s important to remember that the learning process never stops. As an owner, others will look to you for answers, which can create pressure. But, it’s crucial to continue growing and seeking support when needed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Looking at the next generation, there’s often a misconception that “They won’t work as hard as previous generations”. However, today’s business professionals are finding innovative ways to balance work and life. Through outsourcing, leveraging resources like associations and the internet, and using study groups, younger professionals are finding efficient ways to accomplish their goals without overworking themselves. In summary, it’s more about prioritizing balance and using the abundant resources available.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In conclusion, owning and running a funeral business isn’t for everyone, but it can be incredibly rewarding. The key to success lies in taking care of the families you serve…Period! If you can do that, they will take care of you. With the right preparation, support, and willingness to learn, you can enjoy the many benefits of ownership and establish a successful future for you and your family.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In the funeral service profession, financial control is the cornerstone of a sustainable and profitable business. At Johnson Consulting Group, we understand the unique challenges funeral home owners face, from regulatory compliance to managing sensitive customer relations. Mastering financial control ensures your business not only survives but thrives in this compassionate yet competitive field. This article will help you craft a strategic financial plan and implement key strategies to sustain your business.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>Crafting a Strategic Financial Plan for Funeral Homes</strong></h2>
<p>Developing a robust business plan is the first step toward financial mastery in the funeral service profession. This plan serves as a roadmap, guiding your funeral home through budgeting, forecasting, and cash flow management. A well-crafted business plan showcases the viability and strategic vision of your funeral home.</p>
<h3><strong>Key Elements of a Financial Plan:</strong></h3>
<ol>
<li><strong>Budgeting and Forecasting</strong>: Establish clear financial goals and projections to guide your business decisions.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.johnsonconsulting.com/funeral-home-cash-flow-management/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Cash Flow Management</strong></a>: Maintain a steady cash flow to ensure operational efficiency and sustainability. Consider using a thirteen-week cash flow analysis provided on a weekly basis.</li>
</ol>
<p>Understanding a comprehensive financial strategy will enable your funeral home to provide essential services while maintaining financial health.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>Balancing Empathy with Economics in Funeral Service</strong></h2>
<p>Funeral home owners face the delicate task of blending empathy with economic viability. Financial control is crucial in balancing these elements, ensuring that pricing structures are fair and transparent while supporting your business&#8217;s profitability.</p>
<h3><strong>Strategies for Balancing Empathy with Economics:</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Transparent Pricing</strong>: A key consideration would be placing your prices on your website. Also, utilizing phone shopping vendors to ensure you are not only in compliance but providing all options to families guarantees your transparency and compliance.</li>
<li><strong>Cost Management</strong>: Control expenses on essentials like caskets and services to keep operations efficient and families happy.</li>
<li><strong>Revenue Tracking</strong>: A detailed sales contract analysis ensures that you know exactly what the average sales are per case type along with the averages of the items sold within those calls. This ensures that your pricing is not only competitive, but that you&#8217;re recovering your pricing as a correlation to the average sale you&#8217;re receiving.</li>
</ul>
<p>By combining compassionate care with sound financial strategies, you can offer meaningful services while maintaining a viable business model.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>Sustaining Your Funeral Home Business</strong></h2>
<p>Effective financial control is key to sustaining a funeral service business. Strategic planning helps you adapt to market changes while honoring the emotional aspects of our profession.</p>
<h3><strong>Key Financial Strategies for Sustainability:</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Budgeting</strong>: Predictable costs ensure affordability for clients and stability for your business.</li>
<li><a href="https://files.constantcontact.com/d90f336d001/f097c1e4-7b76-427c-b3a9-2a56c1c1315b.pdf?rdr=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Financial Forecasting</strong></a>: Prepare for industry trends and future demands in your market.</li>
<li><strong>Investment in Staff Training</strong>: Enhance service quality and succession planning which fosters client trust and loyalty.</li>
</ul>
<p>A well-structured financial plan empowers your funeral home to meet customer needs with integrity, ensuring both dignified services and business longevity.</p>
<p>In Conclusion, crafting a strategic financial plan is the foundation of a thriving funeral service business. By focusing on budgeting, cash flow management, and balancing empathy with economics, funeral home owners can sustain their operations and serve their communities effectively.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>With the <a href="https://windhambrannon.com/blog/tcja-sunsetting-tax-strategy-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA)</a> provisions set to expire at the end of 2025, business owners and individuals alike face significant tax changes. These changes will affect both personal and business finances. In this Q&amp;A with the Johnson Consulting Team, we’ll explore the major tax provisions expiring and the strategies business owners should consider as the sunset of the TCJA approaches.</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<h2><strong>Q: Which major tax provisions from the TCJA are set to expire at the end of 2025?</strong></h2>
<p>A: Individuals and families can expect tax increases, but for business owners, the most concerning provisions include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Loss of the Section 199A Deduction</strong>: This deduction, currently available to pass-through entities (such as S-corporations and LLCs), allows business owners to deduct up to 20% of qualified business income. When this expires, pass-through entities will lose a valuable tax-saving tool, potentially increasing the tax burden on small businesses and entrepreneurs.</li>
<li><strong>Loss of Caps on State and Local Tax (SALT) Deductions in High-Tax States</strong>: Taxpayers in states with high income and property taxes could face higher overall tax liabilities as the current $10,000 cap on state and local tax deductions disappears.</li>
<li><strong>Reversion of Capital Gains Tax Rates</strong>: Capital gains tax rates will revert to being determined by your regular income tax bracket. This means that individuals in higher income brackets may see a significant increase in their tax rate on long-term capital gains.</li>
<li><strong>Reduction in Estate and Gift Tax Exclusion</strong>: The current estate and gift tax exclusion of $12.92 million per individual will drop by nearly 50%, meaning estates valued over approximately $6 million will be subject to estate taxes. This change could affect many families planning to transfer wealth to the next generation, making estate planning a crucial step in the coming years.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<h2><strong>Q: What tax strategies should funeral home and cemetery business owners consider as 2025 approaches?</strong></h2>
<p>A: One key strategy is to consider accelerating your income before the TCJA provisions expire. With capital gains rates set to revert to higher levels based on your income tax bracket, now is an optimal time to sell assets, take profits, or increase distributions. By doing so, you can take advantage of the lower rates now, reducing your tax liability compared to what it would be under future tax rules.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This strategy is particularly beneficial for those with capital assets such as stocks, real estate, or business interests that have appreciated significantly over time. Locking in current capital gains rates could save you a substantial amount in taxes before the rates increase post-2025.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Other considerations may be to reevaluate your business structure, either converting it to a C-Corp or an S-Corp to lessen taxes. It may also be an opportunity to increase contributions to retirement plans, investing in capital equipment, or exploring tax-advantaged benefits for employees.</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<h2><strong>The Importance of Timing in Succession Planning</strong></h2>
<p>When it comes to succession planning, the timing of a sale can have a significant impact on the value you ultimately retain. In the words of Jake Johnson, &#8220;It&#8217;s not what you get, it&#8217;s what you keep.&#8221; Even though the sale price of a business may remain the same before and after 2025, the amount you keep after taxes will change. This is due to the potential tax increases that could arise when the TCJA provisions expire.</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<h2><strong>Q: How should funeral home and cemetery business owners approaching a succession plan think about the timing of a sale?</strong></h2>
<p>A: If you&#8217;re considering <a href="https://www.johnsonconsulting.com/services/sell-my-business/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">transferring your funeral home or cemetery business</a>, now may be the optimal time to maximize the value of your business. With the potential tax increases on the horizon, selling before the end of 2025 could result in you keeping more of the proceeds.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;It’s just food for thought and something business owners should be aware of,&#8221; Jake continued. &#8220;If you were planning to sell around 2025, the tax changes might push you to reconsider your timing. Even if you’re not quite ready to sell, it’s worth considering whether selling now could help you avoid a higher tax bill later.&#8221;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The core idea is that waiting until 2026 or 2027 could mean a larger tax burden, requiring your business to make up the difference in growth or additional calls on capital. By transferring before the end of 2025, you may be able to capture a more favorable tax position and keep more of the proceeds from the sale. However, it’s important to remember that not everyone will be ready to sell at that time, so planning ahead and discussing options with a tax advisor is crucial.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In conclusion, with the expiration of these TCJA provisions on the horizon, proactive tax and succession planning are essential, working closely with a financial advisor will help you craft the best strategies to minimize your tax burden.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Driving team member engagement is the best way to get the most out of your <a href="https://www.johnsonconsulting.com/services/performance-tracker-x/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">funeral survey program</a> and acts as powerful engine to drive performance.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Encouraging adoption by rewarding wins with some of the ideas below can get you moving in the right direction.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.johnsonconsulting.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Employee-engagement-cycle.png"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-7742 size-full" src="https://www.johnsonconsulting.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Employee-engagement-cycle.png" alt="Employee engagement cycle" width="846" height="479" srcset="https://www.johnsonconsulting.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Employee-engagement-cycle.png 846w, https://www.johnsonconsulting.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Employee-engagement-cycle-480x272.png 480w" sizes="auto, (min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 846px, 100vw" /></a></p>
<h2><strong>Incentive Compensation Plans</strong></h2>
<p>An <a href="https://www.johnsonconsulting.com/4-components-incentive-compensation-plan/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">incentive compensation plan</a> (ICP) is a form of variable compensation for your team members. A common practice is to tie the program to targeted sales, customers’ experiences, and the overall success of the organization. Incentive compensation plans can be customized to whatever metrics are important to the organization. They provide an extra dose of motivation for exceptional workplace performance and increase the chances of maintaining quality talent. Good ICPs must be understandable, fair, easily measurable, and consistent.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Without a doubt, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCbpHRqLhVg" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Performance Tracker X</a> has proved to be an important tool in easily managing ICPs. With Performance Tracker X, your team members can monitor their performance and ICP metrics in real time. This focuses their attention on the metrics that matter to you most while driving their personal growth and the growth of your organization. Increased focus increases survey communication with families which improves response rate and generates more actionable data.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<table>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>Employee Recognition</strong></h2>
<p>The care, compassion, and attention your arranging directors pay to the families they serve is of the utmost importance to them and can weigh heavily. Taking the time to appreciate and recognize successes has been shown to increase productivity, comradery, culture, and loyalty to the company, leading to higher retention.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are many creative ways to accomplish this which take little time or cost.</p>
<ul>
<li>Create an internal awards program for those who had the most perfect surveys responses received, highest response rate, and/or most digital collection.</li>
<li>A monthly “spin-to-win” game with gift cards or other give aways. Add your team members name to the wheel each time a perfect score survey is received.</li>
<li>Forward a congratulatory email each time a perfect score survey is received to the whole team. This allows everyone to feel each other’s success while publicly acknowledging the arranging director.</li>
<li>Highlight an arranging director each month on your social media including some of the positive feedback left in the surveys.</li>
<li>Read the positive feedback outload during team meetings.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Giving a little can get you a lot!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>Providing clarity and setting expectations</strong></h2>
<p>It is important that your team members understand organizational goals and the part they play in achieving those goals. Team members who cannot see beyond their role often feel a reduced sense of satisfaction and fulfillment which can lead to turnover, poor relations between coworkers, and an undesirable work environment. Help your team members to understand the importance of the survey program and how it plays into your larger vision by communicating often and across multiple channels and altitudes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>People retain information differently. Some may rely heavily on verbal communication whereas others may need written information, visual aids, or even examples of the concepts in action. Repetition of the information helps to engrain the importance and communicates that the direction you are providing is here to stay. Ensure adoption at all levels of your organization by breaking down high-level concepts and explaining how they relate to your team members’ day jobs. When you pair the newfound clarity with a framework which spells out the goals or criteria which support the mission, your team members become a part of the bigger picture rather than someone who is simply affected by it.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Funeral homes, crematories, and cemeteries are busy places filled with hazards for employees. Whether embalming, cremating, or digging, employees often find themselves with questions regarding workplace safety, and employers often find themselves thinking about downside risk. <a href="https://www.johnsonconsulting.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Johnson Consulting Group</a> has partnered with <a href="https://certifiedsafetytraining.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Certified Safety Training</a> to elevate compliance in the deathcare industry. What follows are ten steps to creating a comprehensive safety and compliance program.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>#1 Establish a Safety Supervisor</strong></h2>
<p>At a funeral home, crematory, or cemetery, the safety supervisor implements and enforces safety policies and procedures to prevent accidents, injuries, and health hazards in the work environment. Sometimes the employer or general manager holds this position, and other times regular employees hold this position.</p>
<h2><strong>#2 Set Clear Communication Channels</strong></h2>
<p>The safety supervisor works alongside management and employees to communicate safety procedures to employees, and ensure that these procedures are followed. It is also important to remember that even if the employer is not the safety supervisor, it is still the employer&#8217;s responsibility to adequately train the safety supervisor on their duties to be able to help all staff accomplish their work tasks safely.</p>
<h2><strong>#3</strong> <strong>Policy Development</strong></h2>
<p>Create and update safety protocols, guidelines, and procedures in accordance with industry standards and OSHA regulations. This includes safety training programs for employees. This should be done alongside the employer if the employer is not the safety supervisor.</p>
<h2><strong>#4 Risk Assessment</strong></h2>
<p>Conduct regular inspections and risk assessments of the workplace to identify potential hazards and risks. This involves analyzing processes, equipment, and conditions that might pose threats to employee safety. These should be communicated to the employer if the employer is not the safety supervisor.</p>
<h2><strong>#5 Safety Training</strong></h2>
<p>Organize and conduct safety training sessions for employees to educate them about safety protocols, emergency procedures, proper equipment handling, and the use of protective gear.</p>
<h2><strong>#6 Incident Investigation</strong></h2>
<p>Investigate accidents, near-misses, or safety-related incidents to determine their causes and prevent future occurrences. Then, analyze data and implement corrective actions to improve safety. Contact CST to learn about OSHA reporting exceptions in the deathcare industry.</p>
<h2><strong>#7 Localize Compliance</strong></h2>
<p>Ensure that the workplace complies with local, state, and federal safety regulations and standards. Twenty-nine (29) states have state-specific OSHA plans. Be sure to determine if you are in one of them and ensure your OSHA manual, training and recordkeeping meet your state requirements. Then keep abreast of changes in regulations and implement necessary adjustments.</p>
<h2><strong>#8 Emergency Preparedness</strong></h2>
<p>Develop emergency response plans and procedures for various scenarios like fires, chemical spills, or medical emergencies. Then, conduct drills annually to prepare employees for such situations.</p>
<h2><strong>#9 Collaboration</strong></h2>
<p>Work closely with management, HR, and other relevant departments to integrate safety practices into the organizational culture. OSHA training must be conducted “at the time of initial assignment” according to OSHA.</p>
<h2><strong>#10 Documentation and Reporting</strong></h2>
<p>Maintain detailed records of safety inspections, incidents, training sessions, and compliance activities. OSHA will not take your word for it. You must have written proof of all of your compliance and training activities or face citations.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>At Johnson Consulting Group, we evaluate four key areas within a funeral business to gauge its success: financial, workplace, customer service, and marketplace. In this article, we focus on the marketplace, particularly preneed sales, and their impact on the business&#8217;s overall value.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>Preneed Sales: Asset or Liability?</strong></h2>
<p>One of the frequent questions we encounter is whether preneed sales are an asset or a liability for a funeral business. The answer is both. In accounting terms, preneed sales are considered deferred revenue, which is technically a liability. However, the value of a robust preneed book of business is invaluable for future enterprise value.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>Starting with Preneed Programs</strong></h2>
<p>There are numerous third-party marketing companies that can assist with implementing preneed programs, or you can manage it in-house. Regardless of the method, setting a monthly sales target is crucial. Ideally, for every at need contract, we aim to replace it with 1 to 2 preneed contracts.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Our analysis of various funeral homes across the United States and Canada indicates that preneed contracts typically represent 35% of the annual at need case volume at a funeral home. This statistic is often referenced when evaluating the value of the preneed book of business. For instance, a funeral home with $5 million in their preneed account, might see only 35% of that amount come to fruition annually. In other words, that represents 35% of the total at need revenue for the year. Then, taking into consideration the correlating operating expenses of the business, the result is excess cash. This method creates a simple view of how to determine the value of the contribution of the preneed total book of business.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For further insight, consider a funeral home with an annual revenue of $1 million (excluding cash advances), where $350,000 of that revenue is derived from preneed contracts converting to at need. This revenue then incurs expenses, and the resulting <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/ebitda.asp#:~:text=EBITDA%2C%20or%20earnings%20before%20interest,generated%20by%20the%20company's%20operations." target="_blank" rel="noopener">EBITDA</a> (Earnings before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, Amortization) is multiplied to determine the business&#8217;s value. Additionally, preneed sales help lock in today’s family preferences, which is crucial as trends like rising cremation rates continue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>Importance of Monitoring and Training</strong></h2>
<p>We believe that what gets measured gets done. Therefore, having a budget, weekly sales reviews, and consistent <a href="https://www.johnsonconsulting.com/services/jcg-academy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">funeral home training in customer service</a> are essential. Even funeral businesses experiencing a decline in at need volume often maintain consistent preneed case volume. This consistency highlights the loyalty families feel when they pre-plan and return to the same funeral home.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2>
<p>When asked if a preneed program is an asset or liability, it is clear to us that it is a significant asset that enhances the value of a funeral business. However, careful planning and monitoring are necessary to ensure that preneed sales do remain an asset and not a liability. At Johnson Consulting Group, we conduct numerous contract analysis studies and provide strategic planning guidance to ensure the effectiveness of these programs. Our partnerships with third-party experts further support our clients in maximizing their business value through preneed sales.</p>
