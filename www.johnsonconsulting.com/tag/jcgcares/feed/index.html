<p>In our latest Johnson Consulting Conversations, we spoke with Suzanne Akre, Founder and CEO of Akre &amp; Associates and Akre Legacy Recruiting. With over 30 years of recruiting experience, Suzanne shared valuable insights about recruiting in the funeral service profession.</p>
<p>Suzanne never set out to recruit for funeral service—it found her. About a decade ago, her firm began recruiting leaders for an organization serving the death care industry. As her network grew, she discovered that funeral homes, cemeteries, suppliers, and death-tech companies share a common challenge—finding qualified talent.</p>
<p>One challenge that Suzanne often encounters is funeral provider clients being able to give enough time to the hiring process.  She understands how busy a funeral owner or manager can be and is committed to keeping all parties involved updated.</p>
<p>In discussing missed opportunities for prospective candidates Suzanne mentioned that funeral directors rarely manage their brand, making traditional recruiting tools ineffective. Most don&#8217;t have a professional social media presence and are so dedicated to serving families that they don&#8217;t focus on their career growth. Even professionals desperate for change hesitate to take the first step. With that in mind Suzanne established<br />
www.akrelegacyrecruiting.com, creating a landing spot for both funeral providers and professionals seeking career changes.</p>
<p>Suzanne&#8217;s recruitment process begins with learning about the company&#8217;s culture, staff, role history, families served, compensation, growth opportunities, and onboarding. After securing an agreement, her team sources talent, facilitates interviews, and manages the entire process through to placement and beyond.</p>
<p>Timeframes for filling positions vary significantly but on average it takes three to six months to complete the process.  Factors affecting this timeline include geographic challenges, candidate response times, interview scheduling priorities, compensation packages, counteroffers, and relocation issues.</p>
<p>We discussed common mistakes that can be avoided. &#8220;Time kills deals!&#8221; Suzanne emphasized when identifying hiring mistakes. Taking too long to engage candidates, allowing toxic employees to participate in interviews, providing incomplete offer letters, assuming automatic trust, and conducting impersonal interviews are common pitfalls that cost funeral homes top talent.</p>
<p>It was interesting to hear Suzanne’s perspective on what today&#8217;s funeral service professionals seek in workplaces that value them personally and professionally. They want guilt-free PTO, mental well-being support, clear advancement paths, mentorship, and supportive leadership. When choosing employers, they prioritize compensation, location, culture, colleague attitudes, and relocation assistance.</p>
<p>Successful funeral homes build strong teams by offering competitive compensation, implementing thorough onboarding, treating employees exceptionally well, acknowledging community involvement, providing encouragement, and having owners who actively support their staff.</p>
<p>The next generation of funeral directors brings different expectations. Most weren&#8217;t born into this business and many experienced a personal death young, giving them a deep drive to help others. They expect fair pay, mentorship, career growth, mental health support, clear communication, and technology integration.</p>
<p>As an instructor at Worsham College of Mortuary Science, I&#8217;ve observed these shifting mindsets firsthand. Today&#8217;s students are passionate about serving families while seeking balance. They&#8217;re tech-savvy and ask more questions during interviews about schedules, mentorship, and growth opportunities.</p>
<p>We talked in depth about second-career professionals who do differ notably from new first-career graduates. As Suzanne perfectly stated, second-career professionals have &#8220;already done difficult things&#8221; and know their capacity for hard work. Many are drawn to funeral service by personal experiences and bring higher emotional intelligence with less fear of the field. It’s not uncommon for them to have held management positions.  It’s important to know they expect independence and seek leadership opportunities sooner.</p>
<p>Suzanne shared valuable advice for funeral service professionals wanting to stay competitive.  First, keep developing technology skills, work on public speaking abilities, update professional online profiles, leverage networking capabilities, and consider attending compassion cultivation training.</p>
<p>For mortuary students, Suzanne recommends building a professional brand, maintaining a professional social media presence, finding mentors, joining community organizations, developing healthy habits, and remembering their crucial role in guiding families through difficult times. In my Worsham College role, I emphasize that technical skills alone won&#8217;t guarantee success. The graduates who thrive combine interpersonal abilities, adaptability, and commitment to learning with their technical knowledge.</p>
<p>The insights from our conversation highlight the evolving landscape of funeral service recruiting. By focusing on culture, professional development, and adapting to today&#8217;s workforce expectations, funeral providers can succeed in an increasingly competitive market.

<p>Join us for our next conversation with Amanda Hill of Female Forward on April 9th, discussing how funeral providers can better market to female consumers.</p>

<p class="Body">In this month&#8217;s Johnson Consulting Conversations, I had the pleasure of speaking with Bob Arrington, Founder of Arrington Funeral Directors and President of ObituaryShare and marketing for funeral homes.  One of the most significant challenges facing funeral providers today is the evolving nature of obituary sharing. With the decline of local newspapers and rising publication costs, funeral directors have been searching for more effective ways to announce deaths and celebrate lives. Bob shared how this challenge led to the creation of ObituaryShare, a platform designed to address these modern concerns while respecting traditional funeral service values.</p>
<p class="Body">&#8220;The decline in newspaper circulation wasn&#8217;t just about reduced readership,&#8221; Bob explained. &#8220;It meant families were paying more for less exposure, often receiving outdated news in return.&#8221; This reality sparked the need for a digital solution that could provide a broader reach while maintaining the dignity and importance of death notices.</p>
<p class="Body">What makes ObituaryShare unique is its development team&#8217;s diverse background – combining the expertise of a field director, a newspaper veteran, a school teacher, and a social media expert. This varied perspective ensured the platform would be both practical for funeral directors and accessible to families. The goal was simple: enhance existing services without adding complexity to funeral directors&#8217; already demanding schedules.</p>
<p class="Body">The results have been remarkable. Funeral homes using the platform have reported a 74% increase in flower sales and a 19.2% rise in pre-need policy size. The increase in website engagement is even more telling, with average visit duration jumping from 42 seconds to 1.6 minutes, and users exploring more pages per visit.</p>
<p class="Body">One of the most innovative aspects of ObituaryShare is its ability to target specific community groups. Bob shared an example of how an obituary for Jimmy Cruz was strategically promoted to relevant groups, including tire dealers, Boy Scouts, realtors, and bankers – communities that were meaningful to the deceased but might have been missed through traditional channels. The platform&#8217;s success lies in its understanding that Facebook alone isn&#8217;t sufficient for comprehensive obituary sharing. The social media giant&#8217;s algorithms often limit organic reach, necessitating a multi-platform approach to ensure maximum visibility.</p>
<p class="Body">The adoption of <a href="https://www.johnsonconsulting.com/funeral-home-website-needs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">funeral home digital solutions</a> has led to significant business improvements. Funeral homes using ObituaryShare have reported an 8% growth in market share over the past five years, along with increased average revenue per call. The platform has proven particularly effective in reaching key demographics, with 68% of users being females over 55 – a crucial audience for funeral services.</p>
<p class="Body">As the funeral profession continues to evolve, the balance between tradition and innovation becomes increasingly important. Bob emphasized that embracing technology doesn&#8217;t mean abandoning traditional values. Instead, it means enhancing our ability to serve families more effectively. The rise in cremation and memorial services suggests that families are looking for more personalized ways to honor their loved ones, and digital platforms are helping funeral homes meet these changing needs.</p>
<p class="Body">For funeral directors considering digital solutions, Bob&#8217;s advice is straightforward: give it a try. ObituaryShare offers a no-commitment trial period, allowing funeral homes to experience the benefits firsthand without long-term contracts or setup fees. The platform has been designed to integrate seamlessly with existing operations, making the transition to digital as smooth as possible.</p>
<p class="Body">The conversation with Bob Arrington highlighted an important truth about funeral service: while the tools we use may change, our core mission of serving families remains constant. By embracing <a href="https://www.johnsonconsulting.com/funeral-home-marketing-ideas/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">funeral home digital innovation</a>, funeral homes can extend their reach, improve their service offerings, and better support families during their time of need. The future of funeral service lies in finding the perfect balance between traditional values and modern solutions, and platforms like ObituaryShare are helping to bridge that gap.</p>
<p class="Body">Would you like to learn more about how digital solutions can enhance your funeral home&#8217;s services? Visit Arrington Funeral Directors&#8217; website for inspiration on meaningful obituaries or schedule a demo of ObituaryShare to see the platform in action at <a href="https://obituaryshare.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ObituaryShare.com</a></p>

<p class="p1">January&#8217;s Johnson Consulting Conversation featured the incredibly insightful Jill Lazar, VP of Business Development at <a href="https://www.ringringmarketing.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ring Ring Marketing</a>. Jill shared proven strategies for connecting with potential clients, converting cold leads into hot leads, and how funeral providers can energize their approach to pre-need marketing.</p>
<p class="p1">We started with a key concept: the distinction between cold and hot leaders. Jill said to imagine cold leads as people who might be curious about pre-arranging their funeral but aren&#8217;t quite ready to commit. They&#8217;re like explorers, gathering information and weighing options. On the flip side, hot leads are prepared to dive in—they&#8217;ve decided to pre-arrange and are searching for the right partner to help them. The magic lies in transforming those curious explorers into committed clients. This transformation is no small feat and demands a dynamic blend of traditional wisdom and <a href="https://www.johnsonconsulting.com/services/performance-tracker-x/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cutting-edge funeral home technology</a>.</p>
<p class="p1">We know that community outreach is the heartbeat of connection. It&#8217;s where the real excitement happens for making meaningful connections in the community. Jill and I discussed how funeral homes can become trusted advisors in their communities by engaging in genuine outreach. Jill suggested hosting engaging events like movie nights for Veterans or an informative seminar on Veteran death benefits. Events like this cost trust and familiarity. The secret sauce is focusing on relationships, not sales pitches. It&#8217;s about being a trusted friend, not just another business.</p>
<p class="p1">In our fast-paced digital age, you might think direct mail has gone the way of the dinosaurs. Jill shared that direct mail is still a powerhouse. Sending a physical mailer often leads to warmer client interactions than digital alternatives. Why? Because receiving and responding to mail requires a level of commitment that clicks and likes simply don&#8217;t capture. Combining direct mail with social media for events can bring in similar numbers of leads, but the mail leads often close with more success. It&#8217;s all about finding that sweet spot between tradition and innovation.</p>
<p class="p1">Jill and I discussed personalization in marketing, which is more than a trend; it&#8217;s a necessity. Jill stressed that it&#8217;s about making every potential client feel recognized and valued. Recommendations from Jill included using videos and staff photos in marketing materials to send personalized video messages. There are endless ways to make connections feel personal and genuine. The goal is to have potential clients walk through the funeral home doors feeling like they already know you.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Last year Jill posted a video on LinkedIn showing off her cat on National Cat Day. That video turned out to be her most viewed video because it was personal, genuine and it included a pet which was a suggestion from her co-worker.</p>
<p class="p1">Every community is unique, with its own culture and preferences. One size definitely doesn&#8217;t fit all in funeral service marketing. Jill stated that success depends on knowing your audience and tailoring your messages to meet their specific needs. This approach addresses natural sales resistance and positions the funeral director or pre-need consultant as a compassionate advisor. By doing so, you build lasting relationships based on understanding and empathy.</p>
<p class="p1">We know that technology is revolutionizing nearly all industries and different types of businesses. One fascinating idea we explored was the concept of an &#8220;empty cart&#8221; feature on <a href="https://www.johnsonconsulting.com/funeral-home-website-needs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">funeral home websites</a>. People can plan their end-of-life services online, just like shopping on Amazon. This tool provides valuable insights into client preferences. We must remember that technology is only as effective as the people behind it. Ensure your team is well-trained and enthusiastic about using these tools for the best results. Jill mentioned the opportunities that exist when an online consumer has a full shopping cart but doesn&#8217;t check out.</p>
<p class="p1">Patience is a virtue, especially when measuring marketing success in funeral service. Jill advocates for a 12-month evaluation period—pre-need marketing programs often reveal their true potential over time. This patient approach helps avoid hasty judgments and allows strategies to flourish fully.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Balancing tradition with innovation will be crucial for a <a href="https://www.johnsonconsulting.com/enhance-funeral-preneed-sales/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">funeral provider&#8217;s pre-need success</a>. It&#8217;s not about choosing between old and new—it&#8217;s about discovering the perfect blend that resonates with your community.</p>
<p class="p1">Thank you, Jill, for joining us on Johnson Consulting Conversations! Below is the recording in case you missed it live. Be sure to watch the surprise at the end for her and Welton Hong, Founder of Ring Ring Marketing.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p1">In the most recent Johnson Consulting Conversation, I introduced <a href="https://www.johnsonconsulting.com/about/our-team/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Derrick Hussman</a>, Senior Business Consultant for Johnson Consulting Group and a dedicated member of the Disaster Mortuary Operational Response Team (DMORT). Derrick&#8217;s journey in the funeral service industry is as captivating as it is inspiring. From considering a career in broadcasting to finding his calling in forensics and funeral service, Derrick&#8217;s path is a testament to the power of guidance, passion, and willingness to serve.</p>
<p class="p1">As I have learned over the years in speaking with seasoned funeral service professionals and the Worsham College of Mortuary Science students, I teach the path to funeral service, which has not always been a direct path for many. This is undoubtedly true for Derrick. Derrick&#8217;s journey began with a pivotal conversation with his friend Joe Kalmer, who had transitioned from broadcasting to becoming a funeral director. Joe&#8217;s advice encouraged Derrick to explore trade embalming as a means to fund his forensics degree. This decision led Derrick to Southern Illinois University&#8217;s Mortuary Science Program, where he discovered a profound passion for helping families through their most challenging times.</p>
<p class="p1">As Derrick&#8217;s career unfolded, he became involved with DMORT, a federal mortuary response team under the Department of Health and Human Services. DMORT specializes in assisting with mass fatality events by providing forensic and mortuary expertise. With ten teams across the United States, DMORT deploys when local and state resources are overwhelmed, offering critical support through their Disaster Portable Morgue Units and Victim Identification Centers. Derrick&#8217;s journey with DMORT began after volunteering with the National Funeral Directors Association (NFDA) in New York following the 9/11 attacks. Encouraged by DMORT members he met there, Derrick applied and underwent a rigorous selection process, including background checks and security clearances, to join the team.</p>
<p class="p1">Derrick&#8217;s role as a Mortuary Officer in DMORT requires him to be a licensed Funeral Director, and Embalmer is in good standing. Training is extensive, covering harassment prevention, blood borne pathogen safety, psychological first aid, and more. Annual training sessions, often self funded, prepare team members for various disaster scenarios, ranging from plane crashes to severe weather events.</p>
<p class="p1">During deployments, Derrick&#8217;s adaptability and dedication are evident. Every deployment is unique, with team members like Derrick tasked with diverse assignments—managing morgue operations, conducting forensic examinations, and even participating in reconnaissance missions with military forces. Derrick emphasizes the importance of professionalism and teamwork throughout each deployment, ensuring that every task is executed with precision and care.</p>
<p class="p1">Derrick was recently deployed to Asheville, North Carolina, following the devastation of Hurricane Helene. There, he was responsible for managing morgue operations, coordinating with local medical examiners, and strategizing with military search and recovery teams. Despite the challenging conditions, Derrick highlights the deep bonds formed among team members and the resilience of the local community.</p>
<p class="p1">I appreciate that Derrick mentioned the Mercy Chefs organization, which provided warm, nourishing meals to responders and residents.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I had the pleasure of hosting a Johnson Consulting Conversations featuring Nelson Thulin, our Director of Business Consulting. We dived into the topic of funeral home budget success for 2025, during which Nelson provided valuable insights and strategies to help funeral providers thrive in a competitive market and plan accordingly for 2025.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Nelson emphasized the importance of analyzing historical and year-to-date data as a foundational aspect of budgeting and understanding where your funeral home&#8217;s sales trend is crucial for projecting future activity. He advised being honest and realistic when examining past data, as it forms the basis for planning and growth.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Nelson highlighted the shift from traditional burial to cremation services, with an increase in direct cremation and memorial services. Being as detailed as possible with the data is the key, and understanding there is a difference between sustaining growth and sustaining a steady call volume.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>With projections, Nelson discussed the impact of external factors such as market competition and advertising efforts. Recognizing new competitors&#8217; emergence and marketing strategies is vital for staying ahead. He mentioned that new funeral home owners strongly engage in community outreach often, influencing the local market dynamics, and that can have an impact on other area funeral homes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Adjusting pricing can significantly affect sales projections, and Nelson stressed the importance of understanding how these changes influence average sales per call. He also addressed labor expenses, advising owners to consider salaries, overtime, training, and benefits as part of their 2024 budgeting. Nelson recommended viewing training as an investment, not an expense. And, of course, we both agreed that access to performance data from <a href="https://www.johnsonconsulting.com/services/performance-tracker-x/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Performance Tracker X</a> can help customize training content.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We discussed regularly reviewing and maintaining facilities. He advised being brutally honest about facility upkeep, from carpets to wall repairs. Hiring a mystery shopper to evaluate the premises during non-busy times can provide an unbiased perspective on the facility&#8217;s image.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Vehicle-related costs, including maintenance and insurance, are another significant expenditure. Nelson recommended carefully analyzing buying and leasing options. We also briefly discussed advertising and how being very intent and strategic can have a considerable impact, and funeral homes should prioritize advertising channels that yield the best return on investment.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Funeral home owners can confidently navigate financial planning with these insights, ensuring sustainable and successful operations. Watch the entire conversation above! Our next Johnson Consulting Conversation is December 11th at 2 PM EST.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the spirit of World Hospice and Palliative Care Day on October 12th, I asked Greg Grabowski, partner of Hospice Advisors, to join me on the first Johnson Consulting Conversations: Insider Perspectives and Stories. Greg is also a co-author of our book <a href="https://hospiceadvisors.com/product/engaging-the-heart-of-hospice-book/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Engaging the Heart of Hospice</a>. He brings a wealth of experience, working with both non-profit and for-profit hospice organizations across North America and collaborating with funeral providers seeking partnerships with local hospice services.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The subtitle of our book, &#8220;Making Funerals and Memorials an Extension of Hospice Care,&#8221; eludes to hospices and funeral homes having some elements of care in common. The continuum of care can be strong and should be as the loved one and family members transition from hospice care to a funeral provider.  Greg sheds light on what continuum care means to hospice organizations and how care team members work to give each patient and family a comprehensive, coordinated approach to healthcare that ensures seamless services tailored to patients&#8217; needs throughout the end-of-life journey.   Collaboration between hospice and funeral providers can enhance patients&#8217; and their families&#8217; emotional and spiritual well-being.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As discussed with Greg, we acknowledge funeral providers&#8217; challenges when connecting with hospice care team members.  It can be trying to coordinate with the hospice schedule, the time and effort it takes, all while running a funeral home, or assuming the turnover of hospice employees is too high. While the challenges are similar with funeral providers across the country we encourage funeral providers to take the first steps anyways which is gather the date needed to determine which hospices to approach and how to reach out.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Researching and collecting data to identify potential partners includes seven elements:</p>
<p>Knowing if your state is a Certificate of Need state, the number of hospice providers in the funeral home&#8217;s area, which hospices are for-profit and non-profit, the number of Medicare deaths per hospice provider, the range of services and key roles with each hospice and the level of community engagement.  Greg shared a helpful link to identify every hospice.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.medicare.gov/care-compare/?guidedSearch=Hospice&amp;providerType=Hospice" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://www.medicare.gov/care-compare/?guidedSearch=Hospice&amp;providerType=Hospice</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not uncommon for a funeral home owner to say, &#8220;Wow. I didn&#8217;t realize that there were THAT many hospices in my area.&#8221;  I asked Greg to share what could be another ah-ha moment for funeral homes, and that is &#8220;The Hospice Call Ratio&#8221;.  To calculate your hospice call ratio, take the total number of hospice patients for every hospice in your area and divide them by 2. Why 2? Because half of all hospice patients are undecided on their funeral arrangements.  The final calculation reveals the number of opportunities a funeral home has.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since October 12th is World Hospice and Palliative Care Day, I encouraged our attendees to plan on posting to the funeral homes&#8217; social media accounts an appreciation post and tag their local hospice providers. There&#8217;s another big day right around the corner that funeral homes have more time to plan for: Veterans Day on November 11th.  Thousands of hospice providers participate in the program We Honor Veterans, a compassionate initiative designed to provide specialized care and support to veterans facing serious illness and end-of-life challenges.  Greg gives great advice for contacting a hospice provider to discuss being a part of their We Honor Veteran initiatives.  Check that out that part at the ___ mark!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We also talked in depth about having a prepared and heartfelt WHY statement and how it can resonate with hospice care team members.  They have their WHY statements, and they would appreciate it if a funeral director had their WHY statement.  To give you an example of a WHY statement for a funeral director here it is below:</p>
<p>&#8220;My desire to serve families is deeply rooted in the compassion and support I provide to all families during their most challenging times. I am committed to guiding them through honoring their loved one&#8217;s life with dignity and respect. Our funeral home will ensure that every detail reflects the unique story and legacy of loved ones.&#8221;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Notice it doesn&#8217;t say, &#8220;Our funeral home has been in business for 75 years, and our chapel seats 200 guests.&#8221; A personal WHY statement is a heartfelt explanation of why a funeral director is in the funeral service and what it means to care for loved one’s and their family members. As Greg likes to say, &#8220;Hospice professionals don&#8217;t buy what you do but why you do it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I encourage you to check out Johnson Consulting Conversations with Greg. I know you will have more than one key takeaway and feel even more motivated to work closely with your local hospice providers.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Every day more consumers are using the internet as their starting point when searching for goods and services. According to</span><a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/fact-sheet/mobile/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Pew Research</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, 85% of people are carrying a smartphone. Today, your funeral home website is quite often going to be the first impression your company gives to a potential customer. It needs to be a good one.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In this blog, we share five simple ways to make sure your website functions as the front door to your business and keeps your digital doorbell ringing regularly.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li><strong> Keep it simple.</strong></li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">More than half of web users give a website about</span><a href="https://time.com/12933/what-you-think-you-know-about-the-web-is-wrong/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">15 seconds</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to capture their attention. That’s not much. Copy and content that is clear, concise, and to the point helps considerably. Your homepage should be inviting and informative without being heavy and overwhelming.</span></p>
<ol start="2">
<li><strong>Update, update, update</strong></li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Old content is a really easy way to lose a potential customer through your funeral home website. Set aside time regularly to review and update content as needed. Delete old content, add new or rotate customer reviews, and make sure images and videos look fresh.</span></p>
<ol start="3">
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Make sure it’s easy to contact your funeral home  </strong>      </span></li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">How to contact someone in your funeral business should be the easiest thing to find on your website and should exist in more than one place.</span></p>
<ol start="4">
<li><strong>Your ‘About Us’ page goes a long way</strong></li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Invest time on your ‘About Us’ page. The funeral profession is one that thrives on comfort and trust. Helping people feel like they know you and your values can definitely lead to a new customer.</span></p>
<ol start="5">
<li><strong>Be mindful of when your website needs an upgrade</strong></li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The web is a constantly evolving creature. There is always something new or a feature your website could benefit from that wasn’t available when you created the site. Things like search functionality, SEO, and being in </span><a href="https://nfda.org/resources/legal-compliance/other-compliance/americans-with-disabilities-act-ada-compliance-summary" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">ADA compliance</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, should always be on your website maintenance and upgrades list.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Trusted <a href="https://www.johnsonconsulting.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Johnson Consulting Group</a> partner,</span><a href="https://www.funeralresultsmarketing.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Funeral Results Marketing</span></a> <span style="font-weight: 400;">(FRM), can help with all the above and more when it comes to your website.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The priority of many owners is to keep their funeral home business in the family; they want to fulfill the family trust that granted them the business and their commitment to their community.  Great sentiments and I sincerely wish you well in accomplishing these lofty goals.</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">However, it is very likely that your funeral home business will eventually be sold to a consolidator or a nearby competitor looking to enlarge their footprint. Whether you are <a href="https://www.johnsonconsulting.com/timetosellyourfuneralhome/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">selling a funeral home business</a>, your widow, children, or partner is, it is the forces already at play in the industry (such as expensive staffing, decline in traditional services, increasing costs of products, etc.) that will cause the business to be sold. In addition to those factors, the value of larger businesses to consolidators has exceeded anyone’s expectations; the business will be sold.</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">The question you should be asking yourself is whether the proceeds from the sale will be sufficient to meet your future expenses, or the future expenses of your family in your absence. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">30 years ago, Tom Johnson told me that most every funeral business would be bought and sold multiple times during the next several decades. Obviously, Tom was correct, but that’s not the point. Mr. Johnson created a mental picture of a business that could take advantage of that information and it made him extremely successful. You, as an owner, can create the business you and/or your family need to sell in the future to create generational wealth. You can do this by taking advantage of the opportunities that occur in every market. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The coming recession will create many, possibly thousands, of acquisition opportunities as smaller volume firms are challenged. It is extremely likely that some of these under-performing operations could become successful branches for a firm with a stronger brand, trained staff, and financial resources to upgrade facilities. Many of these firms will sell for not much more than property value. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Consolidators, both larger and small, look for firms that have strategically positioned themselves in the market; in other words, they look for businesses that have done the heavy lifting to create the synergies the consolidator will naturally do after they purchase your firm. The investments you make in your business get rewarded financially on the day the business sells. So, what are the investments? As indicated above, the first is growing your business to a citywide, or regional provider. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">But there are other opportunities: look at what the consolidators have paid premium multiples for to identify their priorities: they are looking for add on profits. Certainly, every firm seeks greater volume, but even more important is greater market share and profitability. </span> <span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nearly every consolidator, from Arbor, Park Lawn, and SCI, has invested in reception rooms. Families appreciate the benefits of an on-site reception service, particularly cremation families. Yes, reception rooms require an investment, but if you continue to have a casket selection room, you can accomplish the same digitally, and convert the room for receptions. Once a caterer(s) is selected, providing a reception is no more difficult than ordering a vault placement and bussers to bus the room, which is included in your reception room charge.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cremation businesses, augmented with an ecommerce <a href="https://www.funeralresultsmarketing.com/cremation-arrangement-websites/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cremation arrangement website</a>. Large corporations pay a premium for market share as they are confident in their ability to upgrade cremation families; maybe not immediately, but sooner or later the family will want memorials or receptions, and the large consolidators want to be positioned to sell it to them.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pet disposition was a questionable business for traditional funeral homes, but many providers have created very profitable secondary businesses that may lead to additional human pre-need and at-need business.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cremation niches on funeral home property, or even in the funeral home. Many states allow niches at churches, football stadiums, funeral homes, even small roadside cemeteries. Not legal in every state, which brings us to the issue of antiquated state laws which have been the subject of many previous articles.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Diversify your clientele. Segregation has a long history in traditional Funeral service. It served a purpose when the nation was ethnically divided, and many firms were founded upon a particular ethnic or religious group’s tradition. And, of course, these ethnic based firms continue to exist, but many of them are smaller volume firms, many of which do a poor job of serving their specific community either through exploitive pricing, poor service, neglected facilities, etc. Again, looking at what the consolidators have paid premium multiples for, many of the largest sales have been to businesses with branches that serve ethnic communities; IE: Hispanic, Italians, Greeks, African American, Jewish, Asian, etc. </span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Advertising strategy to position the firm as specialists in serving veterans. Amazingly, few firms located near, or relatively close to national cemeteries, position themselves as the firm specializing in veteran services. Many veterans select cremation even though they would prefer burial, but they or their family are ignorant of the benefits of burial in a national cemetery.  Advertising programs exist to position your firm to capture that business. </span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">An in-house florist display will keep floral orders in your business, and your website can promote your in-house florist.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The most common excuse for not moving a business forward is that it’s all you can do to accomplish your current job, which is likely true. Given the job you have assigned to yourself, it is unlikely you could do more. The objective is to promote yourself to a bigger job by becoming a bigger business. Yes, there is risk, but it is manageable risk. Each of the above listed business building options have proven successful for other businesses. Start with the strategy requiring the least staff and offering the most success with the lowest investment. A cremation arrangement website can generate anywhere from 100 to 1000 cases annually and the only promotion cost is pay per click.  As the business grows, you will add one or two first call drivers and a crematory (assuming state law allows) and a crematory operator.</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<h1><span style="font-weight: 400;">Summary:</span></h1>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What makes this decision difficult is the lack of commitment to grow your business. It’s much easier to continue keeping the job you have and kid yourself that the business will never sell. Someone in the near future will be selling your funeral home; the only question is who will benefit and will it generate sufficient funds to meet your family’s needs.</span> Have questions or want to learn more? <a href="https://www.johnsonconsulting.com/contact-us/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Contact the JCG team today! </a></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Between facilities, land, and equipment, funeral homes possess a wealth of valuable assets; however, the most valuable asset of any business will always be its people. Much like any other component of your funeral home, your staff requires continual investments. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Financial incentives and career growth opportunities can both help engage your employees, but leadership should never overlook the power of positive acknowledgment. Here’s why you should incorporate employee recognition into your performance review meetings. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">1. Greater Employee Satisfaction</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As you might expect, employees appreciate when leadership recognizes their work and achievements; however, many managers underestimate just how much this type of affirmation can mean to their team members.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to a </span><a href="https://www.achievers.com/press/achievers-survey-finds-without-recognition-expect-employee-attrition-2018/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">survey from Achievers</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a majority of employees (69%) value recognition among the top factors they look for in an employer. This surpasses company culture and even opportunities for advancement. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Because of this, leadership should make it a point to continually use performance review meetings as a chance to congratulate and praise the triumphs of their employees. This small action can make a world of difference. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">2. Improve Team Culture</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The leadership of your funeral home sets the tone for your workplace culture. When employees see their leaders conduct themselves in a certain manner, they’ll most often emulate these behaviors.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As such, when leaders make an effort to recognize the achievements of their team, employees will follow suit. The result will be a workplace culture that supports, nurtures, and motivates employees. Rather than compete with one another, team members will honor each other’s achievements and collectively reach for success. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">3. Increase Productivity and Engagement</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">From a logical perspective, employee recognition functions as a form of positive reinforcement. When leadership praises certain behaviors and actions, employees are more likely to continue these behavioral patterns, resulting in increased productivity. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to </span><a href="https://www2.deloitte.com/ie/en/pages/deloitte-private/articles/recognition-programmes.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">research from Deloitte</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, team member engagement, productivity, and performance are 14% higher in organizations that regularly recognize their employees. This same study also found that a 15% increase in engagement can result in a 2% increase in profit margins. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">4. Increase Survey Response Rates</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For leadership teams, it’s essential to solicit feedback from employees, most often as part of the performance review process. However, it can often be difficult for staff members to provide critical feedback to or about their leaders, even if this insight could help improve the workplace.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When team members receive positive feedback, allowing them to see how valued they are in their roles, then they’re more likely to feel emboldened. By empowering employees in this way, leadership can increase the likelihood of receiving positive feedback from employees. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">5. Higher Loyalty and Satisfaction Scores from Families</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the </span><a href="https://hbr.org/2016/05/recognizing-employees-is-the-simplest-way-to-improve-morale?zd_source=hrt&amp;zd_campaign=5503&amp;zd_term=chiradeepbasumallick"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Harvard Business Review</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, 40% of workers say they’d put more effort into their work if they received more recognition from their managers. And when team members feel compelled to excel in their roles, they’ll provide improved service. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The logic is simple: happy, productive employees translate to satisfied families. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">6. Increased Retention of Quality Employees</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Recognition of employees can also increase retention. According to a </span><a href="https://www.achievers.com/press/achievers-survey-finds-without-recognition-expect-employee-attrition-2018/?zd_source=hrt&amp;zd_campaign=5503&amp;zd_term=chiradeepbasumallick"><span style="font-weight: 400;">survey conducted by Achievers</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, recognition and rewards were ranked among the most important motivating factors for staying with a company. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This same survey found that, of those looking to switch jobs, 44% of them noted that a lack of recognition and engagement were contributing factors. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Attain a New Level of Employee Success with JCG Consulting</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While the importance of recognizing employees is clear, it’s not always obvious if your employees currently feel valued. To cut through this lack of certainty, your leadership should administer internal surveys that inquire about job satisfaction. The expertise of consultants can help. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At Johnson Consulting Group, our team of </span><a href="https://www.johnsonconsulting.com/services/business-consulting/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">funeral home business consultants</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> can help you create a strategy for regularly recognizing the work of your employees. By leveraging internal surveys as well as day-to-day tactics, your team can recognize staff members in a way that spurs their productivity and increases retention. For example, we can help you introduce an </span><a href="https://www.johnsonconsulting.com/services/business-consulting/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">incentive compensation plan</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that acknowledges your team’s efforts and ensures they feel valued.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That said, recognition is only one key to the puzzle of engaging your teams. By partnering with JCG consultants, we’ll help you develop a holistic approach to engagement, one that also includes incentive compensation and career development, helping to reach your teams at every touchpoint. </span></p>
