<p>In our latest Johnson Consulting Conversations, we spoke with Suzanne Akre, Founder and CEO of Akre &amp; Associates and Akre Legacy Recruiting. With over 30 years of recruiting experience, Suzanne shared valuable insights about recruiting in the funeral service profession.</p>
<p>Suzanne never set out to recruit for funeral service—it found her. About a decade ago, her firm began recruiting leaders for an organization serving the death care industry. As her network grew, she discovered that funeral homes, cemeteries, suppliers, and death-tech companies share a common challenge—finding qualified talent.</p>
<p>One challenge that Suzanne often encounters is funeral provider clients being able to give enough time to the hiring process.  She understands how busy a funeral owner or manager can be and is committed to keeping all parties involved updated.</p>
<p>In discussing missed opportunities for prospective candidates Suzanne mentioned that funeral directors rarely manage their brand, making traditional recruiting tools ineffective. Most don&#8217;t have a professional social media presence and are so dedicated to serving families that they don&#8217;t focus on their career growth. Even professionals desperate for change hesitate to take the first step. With that in mind Suzanne established<br />
www.akrelegacyrecruiting.com, creating a landing spot for both funeral providers and professionals seeking career changes.</p>
<p>Suzanne&#8217;s recruitment process begins with learning about the company&#8217;s culture, staff, role history, families served, compensation, growth opportunities, and onboarding. After securing an agreement, her team sources talent, facilitates interviews, and manages the entire process through to placement and beyond.</p>
<p>Timeframes for filling positions vary significantly but on average it takes three to six months to complete the process.  Factors affecting this timeline include geographic challenges, candidate response times, interview scheduling priorities, compensation packages, counteroffers, and relocation issues.</p>
<p>We discussed common mistakes that can be avoided. &#8220;Time kills deals!&#8221; Suzanne emphasized when identifying hiring mistakes. Taking too long to engage candidates, allowing toxic employees to participate in interviews, providing incomplete offer letters, assuming automatic trust, and conducting impersonal interviews are common pitfalls that cost funeral homes top talent.</p>
<p>It was interesting to hear Suzanne’s perspective on what today&#8217;s funeral service professionals seek in workplaces that value them personally and professionally. They want guilt-free PTO, mental well-being support, clear advancement paths, mentorship, and supportive leadership. When choosing employers, they prioritize compensation, location, culture, colleague attitudes, and relocation assistance.</p>
<p>Successful funeral homes build strong teams by offering competitive compensation, implementing thorough onboarding, treating employees exceptionally well, acknowledging community involvement, providing encouragement, and having owners who actively support their staff.</p>
<p>The next generation of funeral directors brings different expectations. Most weren&#8217;t born into this business and many experienced a personal death young, giving them a deep drive to help others. They expect fair pay, mentorship, career growth, mental health support, clear communication, and technology integration.</p>
<p>As an instructor at Worsham College of Mortuary Science, I&#8217;ve observed these shifting mindsets firsthand. Today&#8217;s students are passionate about serving families while seeking balance. They&#8217;re tech-savvy and ask more questions during interviews about schedules, mentorship, and growth opportunities.</p>
<p>We talked in depth about second-career professionals who do differ notably from new first-career graduates. As Suzanne perfectly stated, second-career professionals have &#8220;already done difficult things&#8221; and know their capacity for hard work. Many are drawn to funeral service by personal experiences and bring higher emotional intelligence with less fear of the field. It’s not uncommon for them to have held management positions.  It’s important to know they expect independence and seek leadership opportunities sooner.</p>
<p>Suzanne shared valuable advice for funeral service professionals wanting to stay competitive.  First, keep developing technology skills, work on public speaking abilities, update professional online profiles, leverage networking capabilities, and consider attending compassion cultivation training.</p>
<p>For mortuary students, Suzanne recommends building a professional brand, maintaining a professional social media presence, finding mentors, joining community organizations, developing healthy habits, and remembering their crucial role in guiding families through difficult times. In my Worsham College role, I emphasize that technical skills alone won&#8217;t guarantee success. The graduates who thrive combine interpersonal abilities, adaptability, and commitment to learning with their technical knowledge.</p>
<p>The insights from our conversation highlight the evolving landscape of funeral service recruiting. By focusing on culture, professional development, and adapting to today&#8217;s workforce expectations, funeral providers can succeed in an increasingly competitive market.

<p>Join us for our next conversation with Amanda Hill of Female Forward on April 9th, discussing how funeral providers can better market to female consumers.</p>

<p class="Body">In this month&#8217;s Johnson Consulting Conversations, I had the pleasure of speaking with Bob Arrington, Founder of Arrington Funeral Directors and President of ObituaryShare and marketing for funeral homes.  One of the most significant challenges facing funeral providers today is the evolving nature of obituary sharing. With the decline of local newspapers and rising publication costs, funeral directors have been searching for more effective ways to announce deaths and celebrate lives. Bob shared how this challenge led to the creation of ObituaryShare, a platform designed to address these modern concerns while respecting traditional funeral service values.</p>
<p class="Body">&#8220;The decline in newspaper circulation wasn&#8217;t just about reduced readership,&#8221; Bob explained. &#8220;It meant families were paying more for less exposure, often receiving outdated news in return.&#8221; This reality sparked the need for a digital solution that could provide a broader reach while maintaining the dignity and importance of death notices.</p>
<p class="Body">What makes ObituaryShare unique is its development team&#8217;s diverse background – combining the expertise of a field director, a newspaper veteran, a school teacher, and a social media expert. This varied perspective ensured the platform would be both practical for funeral directors and accessible to families. The goal was simple: enhance existing services without adding complexity to funeral directors&#8217; already demanding schedules.</p>
<p class="Body">The results have been remarkable. Funeral homes using the platform have reported a 74% increase in flower sales and a 19.2% rise in pre-need policy size. The increase in website engagement is even more telling, with average visit duration jumping from 42 seconds to 1.6 minutes, and users exploring more pages per visit.</p>
<p class="Body">One of the most innovative aspects of ObituaryShare is its ability to target specific community groups. Bob shared an example of how an obituary for Jimmy Cruz was strategically promoted to relevant groups, including tire dealers, Boy Scouts, realtors, and bankers – communities that were meaningful to the deceased but might have been missed through traditional channels. The platform&#8217;s success lies in its understanding that Facebook alone isn&#8217;t sufficient for comprehensive obituary sharing. The social media giant&#8217;s algorithms often limit organic reach, necessitating a multi-platform approach to ensure maximum visibility.</p>
<p class="Body">The adoption of <a href="https://www.johnsonconsulting.com/funeral-home-website-needs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">funeral home digital solutions</a> has led to significant business improvements. Funeral homes using ObituaryShare have reported an 8% growth in market share over the past five years, along with increased average revenue per call. The platform has proven particularly effective in reaching key demographics, with 68% of users being females over 55 – a crucial audience for funeral services.</p>
<p class="Body">As the funeral profession continues to evolve, the balance between tradition and innovation becomes increasingly important. Bob emphasized that embracing technology doesn&#8217;t mean abandoning traditional values. Instead, it means enhancing our ability to serve families more effectively. The rise in cremation and memorial services suggests that families are looking for more personalized ways to honor their loved ones, and digital platforms are helping funeral homes meet these changing needs.</p>
<p class="Body">For funeral directors considering digital solutions, Bob&#8217;s advice is straightforward: give it a try. ObituaryShare offers a no-commitment trial period, allowing funeral homes to experience the benefits firsthand without long-term contracts or setup fees. The platform has been designed to integrate seamlessly with existing operations, making the transition to digital as smooth as possible.</p>
<p class="Body">The conversation with Bob Arrington highlighted an important truth about funeral service: while the tools we use may change, our core mission of serving families remains constant. By embracing <a href="https://www.johnsonconsulting.com/funeral-home-marketing-ideas/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">funeral home digital innovation</a>, funeral homes can extend their reach, improve their service offerings, and better support families during their time of need. The future of funeral service lies in finding the perfect balance between traditional values and modern solutions, and platforms like ObituaryShare are helping to bridge that gap.</p>
<p class="Body">Would you like to learn more about how digital solutions can enhance your funeral home&#8217;s services? Visit Arrington Funeral Directors&#8217; website for inspiration on meaningful obituaries or schedule a demo of ObituaryShare to see the platform in action at <a href="https://obituaryshare.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ObituaryShare.com</a></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Providing outstanding customer service is a universal goal for businesses, but how do we truly know we’re meeting the mark? Assumptions are not enough. Instead, it requires a systematic approach to evaluate, analyze, and enhance the service we offer. Here’s a step-by-step guide to transforming your customer service process and driving continuous improvement.</p>
<h2><strong>1.The Service…Start with Self-Reflection</strong></h2>
<p>Before seeking external feedback, begin by assessing your current service delivery. This requires vulnerability—being open to recognizing shortcomings and embracing opportunities for growth. Evaluate your processes, interactions, and touchpoints. Where could improvements be made? Honest reflection sets the stage for meaningful progress.</p>
<h2><strong>2.Gather Client Feedback</strong></h2>
<p>Once you’ve acknowledged areas for improvement, the next step is to collect insights directly from your customers. <a href="https://youtu.be/UCbpHRqLhVg?si=IKAOcyZwlN-VMB4b" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Customer satisfaction surveys</a> are an excellent tool for this purpose. These can be distributed digitally (email), via text, or through traditional mail (paper).</p>
<p>Focus on these key areas:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>First Point of Contact</strong>: Often the lowest-rated section in surveys. Ask how the family’s initial interaction with your business felt and identify gaps.</li>
<li><strong>Arrangement Process</strong>: Gather feedback on the ease and efficiency of the arrangement process.  How did the arranger listen and provide the options?</li>
<li><strong>Facilities and Appearance</strong>: Evaluate impressions of your facilities, vehicles, and surroundings.  Have you provided a comfortable and quality environment for the customer.</li>
<li><strong>Service Experience</strong>: For those who utilized your service, dig deeper into their experience.</li>
</ul>
<p>Further questions should include perceptions of the overall value, how customers discovered you, their willingness to leave online reviews, and suggestions for additional services (lead generation).</p>
<h2><strong>3.Act on Feedback Quickly…Real Time Data</strong></h2>
<p>In the movie, “<em>The Godfather”</em>, bad news was expected to be delivered promptly! Similarly, receiving real-time data allows you to address issues immediately rather than letting them go unchecked.  <a href="https://www.johnsonconsulting.com/services/performance-tracker-x/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Johnson Consulting’s Performance Tracker System</a> allows you to leverage the latest technology, providing a rapid response to customer concerns.</p>
<h2><strong>4.Analyze the Data</strong></h2>
<p>Collecting feedback is only valuable if you analyze it effectively. Use robust reporting platforms to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Filter data by time frame, location, or region.</li>
<li>Identify trends and actionable insights.</li>
<li>Generate reports in real time for prompt decision-making.</li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>5.Deploy Actionable Improvements</strong></h2>
<p>With insights in hand, it’s time to implement changes. Review the data with your management team and assign tasks for execution. Ask:</p>
<ul>
<li>What improvements can we make?</li>
<li>Who will be responsible for these changes?</li>
<li>What is the timeline for implementation?</li>
</ul>
<p>Accountability and clear timelines ensure that your efforts translate into measurable results.</p>
<h2><strong>6.Invest in CX Performance Improvement</strong></h2>
<p>Customer experience (CX) isn’t a one-time fix; it requires ongoing commitment. Consider hosting <a href="https://www.johnsonconsulting.com/services/jcg-academy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Johnson Consulting’s CX performance improvement workshops</a> to bolster your service culture. John DiJulius’s book “<em><a href="https://thedijuliusgroup.com/product/the-customer-service-revolution/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Customer Service Revolution</a>”</em> is an excellent resource for understanding how to create a customer-first approach.</p>
<h2><strong>7.Generate Leads Through Exceptional Service</strong></h2>
<p>Satisfied customers naturally become ambassadors for your business. By prioritizing CX and deploying actionable improvements, you create raving fans who are eager to share their experiences. Encourage them to leave online reviews and share testimonials. This not only generates leads but also strengthens your reputation.</p>
<h2><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2>
<p>Customer service excellence is a continuous cycle. Start with honest self-assessment, gather and act on client feedback, analyze data, and implement changes. Invest in your team’s growth through CX workshops, and reap the rewards of lead generation from loyal, satisfied customers. Then, begin the process again to ensure ongoing improvement.</p>
<p>By following these steps, you’ll not only elevate your service standards but also foster a culture of excellence that drives lasting success.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="From Cold Leads to Hot Leads   Strategies to Boost Your Lead Conversion Rates" width="1080" height="608" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_ESYVRdEYQc?feature=oembed"  allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p class="p1">January&#8217;s Johnson Consulting Conversation featured the incredibly insightful Jill Lazar, VP of Business Development at <a href="https://www.ringringmarketing.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ring Ring Marketing</a>. Jill shared proven strategies for connecting with potential clients, converting cold leads into hot leads, and how funeral providers can energize their approach to pre-need marketing.</p>
<p class="p1">We started with a key concept: the distinction between cold and hot leaders. Jill said to imagine cold leads as people who might be curious about pre-arranging their funeral but aren&#8217;t quite ready to commit. They&#8217;re like explorers, gathering information and weighing options. On the flip side, hot leads are prepared to dive in—they&#8217;ve decided to pre-arrange and are searching for the right partner to help them. The magic lies in transforming those curious explorers into committed clients. This transformation is no small feat and demands a dynamic blend of traditional wisdom and <a href="https://www.johnsonconsulting.com/services/performance-tracker-x/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cutting-edge funeral home technology</a>.</p>
<p class="p1">We know that community outreach is the heartbeat of connection. It&#8217;s where the real excitement happens for making meaningful connections in the community. Jill and I discussed how funeral homes can become trusted advisors in their communities by engaging in genuine outreach. Jill suggested hosting engaging events like movie nights for Veterans or an informative seminar on Veteran death benefits. Events like this cost trust and familiarity. The secret sauce is focusing on relationships, not sales pitches. It&#8217;s about being a trusted friend, not just another business.</p>
<p class="p1">In our fast-paced digital age, you might think direct mail has gone the way of the dinosaurs. Jill shared that direct mail is still a powerhouse. Sending a physical mailer often leads to warmer client interactions than digital alternatives. Why? Because receiving and responding to mail requires a level of commitment that clicks and likes simply don&#8217;t capture. Combining direct mail with social media for events can bring in similar numbers of leads, but the mail leads often close with more success. It&#8217;s all about finding that sweet spot between tradition and innovation.</p>
<p class="p1">Jill and I discussed personalization in marketing, which is more than a trend; it&#8217;s a necessity. Jill stressed that it&#8217;s about making every potential client feel recognized and valued. Recommendations from Jill included using videos and staff photos in marketing materials to send personalized video messages. There are endless ways to make connections feel personal and genuine. The goal is to have potential clients walk through the funeral home doors feeling like they already know you.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Last year Jill posted a video on LinkedIn showing off her cat on National Cat Day. That video turned out to be her most viewed video because it was personal, genuine and it included a pet which was a suggestion from her co-worker.</p>
<p class="p1">Every community is unique, with its own culture and preferences. One size definitely doesn&#8217;t fit all in funeral service marketing. Jill stated that success depends on knowing your audience and tailoring your messages to meet their specific needs. This approach addresses natural sales resistance and positions the funeral director or pre-need consultant as a compassionate advisor. By doing so, you build lasting relationships based on understanding and empathy.</p>
<p class="p1">We know that technology is revolutionizing nearly all industries and different types of businesses. One fascinating idea we explored was the concept of an &#8220;empty cart&#8221; feature on <a href="https://www.johnsonconsulting.com/funeral-home-website-needs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">funeral home websites</a>. People can plan their end-of-life services online, just like shopping on Amazon. This tool provides valuable insights into client preferences. We must remember that technology is only as effective as the people behind it. Ensure your team is well-trained and enthusiastic about using these tools for the best results. Jill mentioned the opportunities that exist when an online consumer has a full shopping cart but doesn&#8217;t check out.</p>
<p class="p1">Patience is a virtue, especially when measuring marketing success in funeral service. Jill advocates for a 12-month evaluation period—pre-need marketing programs often reveal their true potential over time. This patient approach helps avoid hasty judgments and allows strategies to flourish fully.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Balancing tradition with innovation will be crucial for a <a href="https://www.johnsonconsulting.com/enhance-funeral-preneed-sales/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">funeral provider&#8217;s pre-need success</a>. It&#8217;s not about choosing between old and new—it&#8217;s about discovering the perfect blend that resonates with your community.</p>
<p class="p1">Thank you, Jill, for joining us on Johnson Consulting Conversations! Below is the recording in case you missed it live. Be sure to watch the surprise at the end for her and Welton Hong, Founder of Ring Ring Marketing.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p1">In the most recent Johnson Consulting Conversation, I introduced <a href="https://www.johnsonconsulting.com/about/our-team/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Derrick Hussman</a>, Senior Business Consultant for Johnson Consulting Group and a dedicated member of the Disaster Mortuary Operational Response Team (DMORT). Derrick&#8217;s journey in the funeral service industry is as captivating as it is inspiring. From considering a career in broadcasting to finding his calling in forensics and funeral service, Derrick&#8217;s path is a testament to the power of guidance, passion, and willingness to serve.</p>
<p class="p1">As I have learned over the years in speaking with seasoned funeral service professionals and the Worsham College of Mortuary Science students, I teach the path to funeral service, which has not always been a direct path for many. This is undoubtedly true for Derrick. Derrick&#8217;s journey began with a pivotal conversation with his friend Joe Kalmer, who had transitioned from broadcasting to becoming a funeral director. Joe&#8217;s advice encouraged Derrick to explore trade embalming as a means to fund his forensics degree. This decision led Derrick to Southern Illinois University&#8217;s Mortuary Science Program, where he discovered a profound passion for helping families through their most challenging times.</p>
<p class="p1">As Derrick&#8217;s career unfolded, he became involved with DMORT, a federal mortuary response team under the Department of Health and Human Services. DMORT specializes in assisting with mass fatality events by providing forensic and mortuary expertise. With ten teams across the United States, DMORT deploys when local and state resources are overwhelmed, offering critical support through their Disaster Portable Morgue Units and Victim Identification Centers. Derrick&#8217;s journey with DMORT began after volunteering with the National Funeral Directors Association (NFDA) in New York following the 9/11 attacks. Encouraged by DMORT members he met there, Derrick applied and underwent a rigorous selection process, including background checks and security clearances, to join the team.</p>
<p class="p1">Derrick&#8217;s role as a Mortuary Officer in DMORT requires him to be a licensed Funeral Director, and Embalmer is in good standing. Training is extensive, covering harassment prevention, blood borne pathogen safety, psychological first aid, and more. Annual training sessions, often self funded, prepare team members for various disaster scenarios, ranging from plane crashes to severe weather events.</p>
<p class="p1">During deployments, Derrick&#8217;s adaptability and dedication are evident. Every deployment is unique, with team members like Derrick tasked with diverse assignments—managing morgue operations, conducting forensic examinations, and even participating in reconnaissance missions with military forces. Derrick emphasizes the importance of professionalism and teamwork throughout each deployment, ensuring that every task is executed with precision and care.</p>
<p class="p1">Derrick was recently deployed to Asheville, North Carolina, following the devastation of Hurricane Helene. There, he was responsible for managing morgue operations, coordinating with local medical examiners, and strategizing with military search and recovery teams. Despite the challenging conditions, Derrick highlights the deep bonds formed among team members and the resilience of the local community.</p>
<p class="p1">I appreciate that Derrick mentioned the Mercy Chefs organization, which provided warm, nourishing meals to responders and residents. Mercy Chefs is a wonderful non-profit, and I&#8217;ve had the opportunity to volunteer for when floods hit eastern Kentucky. Check them out if you like working in the kitchen and prefer short-term volunteer opportunities. <a href="https://mercychefs.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">www.mercychefs.com</a></p>
<p class="p1">The support provided by DMORT during such crises is crucial for families, offering a semblance of peace by facilitating the identification and release of deceased loved ones. Derrick&#8217;s work, while challenging, strengthens his faith in humanity and the power of compassion during times of tragedy. Learning more about this passion that drives DMORT to help others was genuinely touching.</p>
<p class="p1">The emotional demands of disaster response work are significant. Derrick and his team approach their mission with a steadfast mindset, understanding the critical role they play in facilitating families&#8217; grieving process. Derrick&#8217;s commitment to providing dignified and expedited support is a testament to his dedication and the essential nature of DMORT&#8217;s mission.</p>
<p class="p1">For those inspired by Derrick&#8217;s journey and considering a path in disaster response, Derrick emphasizes the importance of the passion to serve. The work requires mental and physical resilience, adaptability, and an unwavering commitment to the mission. Aspiring DMORT members are encouraged to explore state teams and stay informed about opportunities through platforms like <a href="https://www.usajobs.gov/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">USAJOBS.GOV</a>.</p>
<p class="p1">Derrick&#8217;s journey inspires others to embrace the call to serve, highlighting the vital role that DMORT plays in disaster response and the healing process for grieving families. Johnson Consulting Group is proud of Derrick&#8217;s work, which not only aids those in need but also inspires a new generation to follow in his footsteps, serving with dignity and compassion in times of tragedy.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I had the pleasure of hosting a Johnson Consulting Conversations featuring Nelson Thulin, our Director of Business Consulting. We dived into the topic of funeral home budget success for 2025, during which Nelson provided valuable insights and strategies to help funeral providers thrive in a competitive market and plan accordingly for 2025.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Nelson emphasized the importance of analyzing historical and year-to-date data as a foundational aspect of budgeting and understanding where your funeral home&#8217;s sales trend is crucial for projecting future activity. He advised being honest and realistic when examining past data, as it forms the basis for planning and growth.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Nelson highlighted the shift from traditional burial to cremation services, with an increase in direct cremation and memorial services. Being as detailed as possible with the data is the key, and understanding there is a difference between sustaining growth and sustaining a steady call volume.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>With projections, Nelson discussed the impact of external factors such as market competition and advertising efforts. Recognizing new competitors&#8217; emergence and marketing strategies is vital for staying ahead. He mentioned that new funeral home owners strongly engage in community outreach often, influencing the local market dynamics, and that can have an impact on other area funeral homes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Adjusting pricing can significantly affect sales projections, and Nelson stressed the importance of understanding how these changes influence average sales per call. He also addressed labor expenses, advising owners to consider salaries, overtime, training, and benefits as part of their 2024 budgeting. Nelson recommended viewing training as an investment, not an expense. And, of course, we both agreed that access to performance data from <a href="https://www.johnsonconsulting.com/services/performance-tracker-x/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Performance Tracker X</a> can help customize training content.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We discussed regularly reviewing and maintaining facilities. He advised being brutally honest about facility upkeep, from carpets to wall repairs. Hiring a mystery shopper to evaluate the premises during non-busy times can provide an unbiased perspective on the facility&#8217;s image.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Vehicle-related costs, including maintenance and insurance, are another significant expenditure. Nelson recommended carefully analyzing buying and leasing options. We also briefly discussed advertising and how being very intent and strategic can have a considerable impact, and funeral homes should prioritize advertising channels that yield the best return on investment.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Funeral home owners can confidently navigate financial planning with these insights, ensuring sustainable and successful operations. Watch the entire conversation above! Our next Johnson Consulting Conversation is December 11th at 2 PM EST.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the spirit of World Hospice and Palliative Care Day on October 12th, I asked Greg Grabowski, partner of Hospice Advisors, to join me on the first Johnson Consulting Conversations: Insider Perspectives and Stories. Greg is also a co-author of our book <a href="https://hospiceadvisors.com/product/engaging-the-heart-of-hospice-book/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Engaging the Heart of Hospice</a>. He brings a wealth of experience, working with both non-profit and for-profit hospice organizations across North America and collaborating with funeral providers seeking partnerships with local hospice services.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The subtitle of our book, &#8220;Making Funerals and Memorials an Extension of Hospice Care,&#8221; eludes to hospices and funeral homes having some elements of care in common. The continuum of care can be strong and should be as the loved one and family members transition from hospice care to a funeral provider.  Greg sheds light on what continuum care means to hospice organizations and how care team members work to give each patient and family a comprehensive, coordinated approach to healthcare that ensures seamless services tailored to patients&#8217; needs throughout the end-of-life journey.   Collaboration between hospice and funeral providers can enhance patients&#8217; and their families&#8217; emotional and spiritual well-being.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As discussed with Greg, we acknowledge funeral providers&#8217; challenges when connecting with hospice care team members.  It can be trying to coordinate with the hospice schedule, the time and effort it takes, all while running a funeral home, or assuming the turnover of hospice employees is too high. While the challenges are similar with funeral providers across the country we encourage funeral providers to take the first steps anyways which is gather the date needed to determine which hospices to approach and how to reach out.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Researching and collecting data to identify potential partners includes seven elements:</p>
<p>Knowing if your state is a Certificate of Need state, the number of hospice providers in the funeral home&#8217;s area, which hospices are for-profit and non-profit, the number of Medicare deaths per hospice provider, the range of services and key roles with each hospice and the level of community engagement.  Greg shared a helpful link to identify every hospice.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.medicare.gov/care-compare/?guidedSearch=Hospice&amp;providerType=Hospice" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://www.medicare.gov/care-compare/?guidedSearch=Hospice&amp;providerType=Hospice</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not uncommon for a funeral home owner to say, &#8220;Wow. I didn&#8217;t realize that there were THAT many hospices in my area.&#8221;  I asked Greg to share what could be another ah-ha moment for funeral homes, and that is &#8220;The Hospice Call Ratio&#8221;.  To calculate your hospice call ratio, take the total number of hospice patients for every hospice in your area and divide them by 2. Why 2? Because half of all hospice patients are undecided on their funeral arrangements.  The final calculation reveals the number of opportunities a funeral home has.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since October 12th is World Hospice and Palliative Care Day, I encouraged our attendees to plan on posting to the funeral homes&#8217; social media accounts an appreciation post and tag their local hospice providers. There&#8217;s another big day right around the corner that funeral homes have more time to plan for: Veterans Day on November 11th.  Thousands of hospice providers participate in the program We Honor Veterans, a compassionate initiative designed to provide specialized care and support to veterans facing serious illness and end-of-life challenges.  Greg gives great advice for contacting a hospice provider to discuss being a part of their We Honor Veteran initiatives.  Check that out that part at the ___ mark!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We also talked in depth about having a prepared and heartfelt WHY statement and how it can resonate with hospice care team members.  They have their WHY statements, and they would appreciate it if a funeral director had their WHY statement.  To give you an example of a WHY statement for a funeral director here it is below:</p>
<p>&#8220;My desire to serve families is deeply rooted in the compassion and support I provide to all families during their most challenging times. I am committed to guiding them through honoring their loved one&#8217;s life with dignity and respect. Our funeral home will ensure that every detail reflects the unique story and legacy of loved ones.&#8221;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Notice it doesn&#8217;t say, &#8220;Our funeral home has been in business for 75 years, and our chapel seats 200 guests.&#8221; A personal WHY statement is a heartfelt explanation of why a funeral director is in the funeral service and what it means to care for loved one’s and their family members. As Greg likes to say, &#8220;Hospice professionals don&#8217;t buy what you do but why you do it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I encourage you to check out Johnson Consulting Conversations with Greg. I know you will have more than one key takeaway and feel even more motivated to work closely with your local hospice providers.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The funeral profession is on the brink of a significant shift, with 50% of funeral businesses expected to change hands as the next generation takes the reins.The burning question for funeral home owners is not just how to adapt to this change, but how to turn it into a catalyst for exponential growth. Here’s our roadmap designed to transform this industry shift into an opportunity for your funeral home to thrive: </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1><b>First, Let’s Get Your &#8220;House&#8221; in Order </b></h1>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>Business Assessment </strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ensuring success begins by strengthening the core of your operations. Think of the thorough operational checkup as checking the heartbeat of your funeral home in the areas of workplace, financial management, market place, and customer service. Recognize your strengths, find areas for growth, and locate where you can make things run smoother. It’s like giving your business a health check to make sure it’s in top shape for the journey ahead. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.johnsonconsulting.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/4-Pillars-Of-Success-V2133433.png"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-7652 size-large" src="https://www.johnsonconsulting.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/4-Pillars-Of-Success-V2133433-1024x645.png" alt="JCG's 4 pillars or success, CX, workplace, market place, financial management" width="1024" height="645" srcset="https://www.johnsonconsulting.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/4-Pillars-Of-Success-V2133433-1024x645.png 1024w, https://www.johnsonconsulting.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/4-Pillars-Of-Success-V2133433-980x617.png 980w, https://www.johnsonconsulting.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/4-Pillars-Of-Success-V2133433-480x302.png 480w" sizes="auto, (min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) and (max-width: 980px) 980px, (min-width: 981px) 1024px, 100vw" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>Strategic Planning</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Identifying areas of opportunity within your business can only be created by a strategic plan, this is where many businesses fail. We are staffed appropriately to manage the daily operations but not to execute on areas of opportunity identified in a <a href="https://www.johnsonconsulting.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/JCG-Assessment-One-Pager-10.4.23-1.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">business assessment.</a> </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>Customer Service “CX” Culture Training </strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://lp.constantcontactpages.com/su/CKDNABr/LMSpring24" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Strengthen your internal team</a> by cultivating a culture that’s eager to embrace expansion. Enhance communication channels, ensuring everyone is passionately engaged in the exciting road ahead. A united and empowered team is the driving force to ensure that your funeral home can grow successfully in the dynamic landscape of acquisitions. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1><b>Now, What You Need For A Successful Succession </b></h1>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Expanding your business isn’t just about being brave—it&#8217;s about knowing what you&#8217;re doing and having a plan</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. From funding the dream to</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> knowing how much your business is worth,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> there’s a lot to consider when moving through a successful succession.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><b>Determining the Right Price</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://www.johnsonconsulting.com/what-goes-into-a-funeral-home-valuation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Valuation</a> isn&#8217;t just numbers; it&#8217;s an art. Learn the art of valuing funeral homes, taking into account industry-specific factors. Master negotiation strategies to ensure a fair and mutually beneficial deal. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><b>Funding the Dream</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It starts with funding. Know your cash flow, understand the assets involved, and make sure you can <a href="https://www.johnsonconsulting.com/services/loans/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">manage any funeral home loans</a>. Explore different funding options while keeping your business stable. Evaluating various financing options without sacrificing your business’s stability is vital to success, underscoring the importance of amortization, interest rates and balloon payments, among others. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><b>Understanding the Structure</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With any business value, the details of it are the structure. It has been said that you can make any value work if the structure is correct. For that reason, knowing among other things, what to allocate to cash, to a loan, to a non-compete agreement, and to consulting agreements, are critical. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><b>Successfully Onboarding a New Acquisition</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The real magic happens post-deal. Craft a plan for a smooth transition, addressing challenges before they arise. Ensure the cultural integration of teams to create harmony within your funeral home. How do you do this? …. Due diligence and a strategic plan! </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Each step is a critical part in mastering the deal. Armed with knowledge and equipped with strategies, <a href="https://www.johnsonconsulting.com/services/funeral-home-and-cemetery-business-brokers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Johnson Consulting Group can help you step confidently into the future of acquisitions. </a></span></i></p>
