										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a shifting economy where consumers are faced with inflation and unreliable availability of products and resources, one thing remains clear, excellent customer care matters. Taking the time to treat people as you would like to be treated builds lasting relationships which means stability for your business and your staff and can also lead to growth over time.  </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to</span><a href="https://www.cxnetwork.com/cx-experience/articles/why-customer-loyalty-is-so-important-in-2023"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">the CX Network</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, 93 percent of customers who receive an enjoyable customer experience are likely to return to that brand. The article goes on to say that things like personalization and individualization really matter to people. This is good news for the funeral profession, meeting people where they are and providing a personalized experience are paramount to the field.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We hear a lot about loyalty and loyalty programs when diving into customer service education and enrichment.</span><a href="https://www.johnsonconsulting.com/4-ways-to-ensure-consistent-customer-retention/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Ensure consistent customer</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> retention by really focusing on the family experience and training and supporting your staff to be able to do the same, at every level and every possible touchpoint. Another way to build loyalty is to participate within your community. Attend community events and partner with other organizations where it makes sense. Become a comforting and known name within your community.  </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But how do you balance all of this and stay aware of the fine details? One thing we stand by at JCG is having the tools to help you achieve your business goals.</span><a href="https://www.j3techsolutions.com/performance-tracker/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Performance Tracker X</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is a great addition to your toolkit when it comes to keeping track of family satisfaction and helpful information to improve staff engagement.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Every funeral director knows the importance of having a website for their business; however, few leverage their websites to their full potential. As well as displaying contact information and showcasing the expertise of your staff, a funeral home website can be a valuable tool for generating revenue and selling and growing your sales. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By taking the time to create a smooth user experience and provide options for online selections, a website can become an integral source of outreach and ecommerce revenue. Here are some tips for success.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Enticing, User-Friendly Website</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Just as your grounds and facilities create a first impression for in-person clients, your website does the same for online visitors, effectively serving as your digital storefront. With this in mind, you’ll want to make sure it’s presentable. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">For starters, you’ll want to include some helpful images and videos that showcase the strengths of your funeral home. Consider including photos of your leadership and staff. You might even throw in a video walkthrough of your facilities, helping users understand how a service might look with your business. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Finally, your website should also be easy to use. This part might take some trial and error, but optimization is worth the effort. Ideally, when a user visits your website, there will be clearly displayed links to contacting your business, learning more about its history, and even selecting atneed and preneed arrangements.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Online Shopping (E-Commerce)</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Funeral services usually require in-person consultations, during at which time clients select their type of service and gain more information about pricing. However, a growing number of people </span><a href="https://maristpoll.marist.edu/wp-content/misc/usapolls/us180423_NPR/NPR_Marist%20Poll_Tables%20of%20Questions_May%202018.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">prefer to shop online</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, particularly younger generations. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To meet the needs of this type of client, your website should allow people to select services online. For example, a website built by </span><a href="https://www.funeralresultsmarketing.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Funeral Results Marketing</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is a modern, user-friendly experience that helps visitors discover your funeral home, access the information they need, and begin browsing your services.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, if a person is looking for a cremation package, they should be able to schedule and pay for it online through your </span><a href="https://www.funeralresultsmarketing.com/cremation-arrangement-websites/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">cremation arrangement website</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Alternatively, people should be able to book standardized funeral packages online when appropriate. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Particularly when it comes to selling preneed funeral arrangements, offering them online greatly increases the chances of people completing a purchase. People may not know you can pre-arrange funeral services, and displaying this option on your website can help increase the visibility of this offering.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Naturally, death care rituals require a level of individualization that’s difficult to accomplish without consultation. There’s hardly a one-size-fits-all approach to funerals; however, your online offerings can serve as base packages. Once your team makes contact with an interested family, you can then discuss additional customization options. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Transparent Pricing</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before making a purchase, the </span><a href="https://www.invoca.com/blog/retail-marketing-statistics"><span style="font-weight: 400;">vast majority of shoppers conduct research</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, including comparing prices between vendors. Because of this, it’s important to </span><a href="https://www.johnsonconsulting.com/the-dos-and-donts-of-budgeting-and-strategic-pricing-initiatives/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">display prices on your website</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When a person has no idea what they can expect to pay for a funeral service, they’re less likely to follow through and select your business. Alternatively, having a price displayed, even if it only represents a base rate, can make them feel more confident about making a purchase. Even if your website price isn’t the lowest, the act of displaying a price allows you to demonstrate your value and transparency, noting exactly what’s included with each service. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Marketing</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Your website will also play a key role in any type of </span><a href="https://www.johnsonconsulting.com/funeral-home-marketing-ideas/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">digital marketing</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. If you plan to run ads on Google, Bing, Facebook, Instagram, or other social media, they’ll inevitably link back to your website. Ideally, your ads and website will work hand-in-hand, the former directing them to your site and the latter compelling them to select a service. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Additionally, your website can organically gain traffic by targeting relevant keywords. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Use your site&#8217;s blog section to create informative and useful content about death care. Your site will begin to rank more highly in online searches, ultimately increasing your business&#8217; visibility and customer base. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Consultation Services with JCG</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Managing a website can easily become a full-time job. After all, many larger businesses devote entire teams to building and overseeing their web presence. For smaller businesses, particularly those new to the world of digital marketing, it’s often helpful to rely on the expertise of consultants. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At Johnson Consulting Group (JCG), our team of death care consultants can partner with your business to </span><a href="https://www.johnsonconsulting.com/services/business-consulting/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">create a holistic marketing strategy</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, one that helps you build a website that drives e-commerce. With years of experience helping funeral businesses of all sizes, our team is familiar with industry-wide best practices and can help you implement them in your own marketing practice. </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As the funeral profession evolves, so must your efforts to meet the needs of families. Beyond upgrading their facilities and offering innovative memorial services, funeral homes must also consider the way in which they attract new business, that is, their marketing strategy. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gone are the days of guaranteed loyalty from families in the community. With competition increasing throughout the country, you can no longer rely on the passive acquisition of clients. Instead, funeral homes must take an active approach to raise awareness of their services and compelling families to book.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here are some frequently heard myths about funeral home marketing and how you can implement more effective approaches. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">1. Word of Mouth Is Enough</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When a person talks about a funeral home’s services to their friends, family, and acquaintances, this is what’s known as word of mouth marketing. And while this type of free advertising is </span><a href="https://review42.com/resources/word-of-mouth-marketing-statistics/#:~:text=WOMM%20brings%20in%205%20times,most%20effective%20form%20of%20marketing." target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">incredibly effective</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">––after all, people tend to trust their friends over media outlets––word of mouth is unpredictable. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rather than wait for clients to organically rave about your funeral home, you should encourage them to do so. When thanking families for booking a service, politely ask them to share their experience on social media and tag your funeral home’s pages. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition to asking families to talk about your business online, you should also ask them to complete a survey discussing their experience. Surveying families is one of the most effective ways to understand how your funeral home currently meets their needs and learn how you can do better. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">2. Reviews Manage Themselves</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In many cases when a person runs a Google search for your funeral home, reviews from former families will be among the first things they see, making it important that they leave a good impression. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One study finds that </span><a href="https://www.qualtrics.com/blog/online-review-stats/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">93% of people read online reviews</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> before buying a product or service. With this in mind, you’ll want to make sure that your portfolio of online reviews accomplishes two goals. </span></p>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Accrue as many positive reviews as possible.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Both the quantity and quality of these reviews will also </span><a href="https://www.searchenginepeople.com/blog/just-how-much-do-google-reviews-impact-your-seo-ranking.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">help your SEO</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, making your funeral home appear near the top of Google searches. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Respond to negative reviews.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> If a person is researching your </span><a href="https://www.johnsonconsulting.com/difference-between-happy-and-satisfied-funeral-families/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">funeral home’s reputation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">, their eye will undoubtedly be drawn to negative reviews. Because of this, you want to take time to mitigate their impact by responding to dissatisfied families in a thoughtful, apologetic tone. Remember, they are likely working with you during some of the most emotional moments of their life.</span></span>&nbsp;</li>
</ol>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">3. A Website Is Unnecessary</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With social media pages and listings in online business directories, you might think that a standalone website is superfluous; however, a funeral home website is an essential component of your branding and outreach. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One study finds that a business’s </span><a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/blog/tabid/6307/bid/5501/Research-Shows-Websites-Influence-97-of-Clients-Purchasing-Decisions.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">website influences 97%</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of clients’ purchasing decisions. Think of your website as a digital first impression. When a person searches for your funeral home online, they’ll likely look to your website for authoritative information related to hours, phone numbers, services, and professionalism. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">4. At Need Is the Most Important Audience</span></h2>
<p><a href="https://www.johnsonconsulting.com/preneed-funeral-sales/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Increasing your preneed sales</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is one of the most effective ways to increase the value of your funeral home as well as ensure business in the future. To build a preneed sales program, you’ll want to address several family touchpoints: online, in-person, and through partnerships. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many people are unaware that they can book a funeral service ahead of time, so your first step will be education. By letting people know that options are available ahead of time––and training your sales team in preneed practices––you can increase the likelihood of people booking these services and flesh out your preneed backlog. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Continue Growing</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unless you have a proactive approach to reaching your current and prospective families, you’ll undoubtedly fall behind the competition. To ensure the best returns on your marketing efforts, it’s often helpful to </span><a href="https://www.johnsonconsulting.com/6-things-to-look-for-in-a-funeral-business-consultant/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">call in consultants</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At Johnson Consulting Group, our team of funeral home consultants has helped funeral homes in all stages and sizes develop marketing strategies that deliver consistent results. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Armed with a knowledge of both funeral-specific outreach practices and marketplace trends, they can help your team build a strategy that enshrines continued business while bringing new families into the fold. </span></p>
