<p>The <a href="https://www.johnsonconsulting.com/services/performance-tracker-x/">JCG Performance Tracker X</a> tool provides funeral homes and cemeteries timely, accurate measurements of customer service and sale performance.  The software offers comprehensive reporting that shows business owners what they are doing well and identifies the areas that need fine-tuning and improvements.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Johnson Consulting Group started its customer survey program in 2008. This large amount of survey data has proven invaluable to providing insight into customer needs and satisfaction. The company attributes the program’s growth based on its ability to offer the program with no contract to sign, a low monthly cost, and accessibility to its management professionals for interpretation and usefulness of the reports.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“With the commoditization of products and services in our society, providing an exceptionally high level of customer service is critical to differentiating us from our competition. At the average sale of a funeral today, the loss of even one family can have material impacts on a business and its value. The answer to continual improvement is to survey our customers, ask the difficult questions, ask for a review online, and recover when there&#8217;s an issue”, says Jake Johnson, President and CEO of Johnson Consulting Group.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Innovative Marketing for Funeral Homes: Insights from Bob Arrington on ObituaryShare" width="1080" height="608" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/f--ju2LN4P0?feature=oembed"  allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p class="Body">In this month&#8217;s Johnson Consulting Conversations, I had the pleasure of speaking with Bob Arrington, Founder of Arrington Funeral Directors and President of ObituaryShare and marketing for funeral homes.  One of the most significant challenges facing funeral providers today is the evolving nature of obituary sharing. With the decline of local newspapers and rising publication costs, funeral directors have been searching for more effective ways to announce deaths and celebrate lives. Bob shared how this challenge led to the creation of ObituaryShare, a platform designed to address these modern concerns while respecting traditional funeral service values.</p>
<p class="Body">&#8220;The decline in newspaper circulation wasn&#8217;t just about reduced readership,&#8221; Bob explained. &#8220;It meant families were paying more for less exposure, often receiving outdated news in return.&#8221; This reality sparked the need for a digital solution that could provide a broader reach while maintaining the dignity and importance of death notices.</p>
<p class="Body">What makes ObituaryShare unique is its development team&#8217;s diverse background – combining the expertise of a field director, a newspaper veteran, a school teacher, and a social media expert. This varied perspective ensured the platform would be both practical for funeral directors and accessible to families. The goal was simple: enhance existing services without adding complexity to funeral directors&#8217; already demanding schedules.</p>
<p class="Body">The results have been remarkable. Funeral homes using the platform have reported a 74% increase in flower sales and a 19.2% rise in pre-need policy size. The increase in website engagement is even more telling, with average visit duration jumping from 42 seconds to 1.6 minutes, and users exploring more pages per visit.</p>
<p class="Body">One of the most innovative aspects of ObituaryShare is its ability to target specific community groups. Bob shared an example of how an obituary for Jimmy Cruz was strategically promoted to relevant groups, including tire dealers, Boy Scouts, realtors, and bankers – communities that were meaningful to the deceased but might have been missed through traditional channels. The platform&#8217;s success lies in its understanding that Facebook alone isn&#8217;t sufficient for comprehensive obituary sharing. The social media giant&#8217;s algorithms often limit organic reach, necessitating a multi-platform approach to ensure maximum visibility.</p>
<p class="Body">The adoption of <a href="https://www.johnsonconsulting.com/funeral-home-website-needs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">funeral home digital solutions</a> has led to significant business improvements. Funeral homes using ObituaryShare have reported an 8% growth in market share over the past five years, along with increased average revenue per call. The platform has proven particularly effective in reaching key demographics, with 68% of users being females over 55 – a crucial audience for funeral services.</p>
<p class="Body">As the funeral profession continues to evolve, the balance between tradition and innovation becomes increasingly important. Bob emphasized that embracing technology doesn&#8217;t mean abandoning traditional values. Instead, it means enhancing our ability to serve families more effectively. The rise in cremation and memorial services suggests that families are looking for more personalized ways to honor their loved ones, and digital platforms are helping funeral homes meet these changing needs.</p>
<p class="Body">For funeral directors considering digital solutions, Bob&#8217;s advice is straightforward: give it a try. ObituaryShare offers a no-commitment trial period, allowing funeral homes to experience the benefits firsthand without long-term contracts or setup fees. The platform has been designed to integrate seamlessly with existing operations, making the transition to digital as smooth as possible.</p>
<p class="Body">The conversation with Bob Arrington highlighted an important truth about funeral service: while the tools we use may change, our core mission of serving families remains constant. By embracing <a href="https://www.johnsonconsulting.com/funeral-home-marketing-ideas/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">funeral home digital innovation</a>, funeral homes can extend their reach, improve their service offerings, and better support families during their time of need. The future of funeral service lies in finding the perfect balance between traditional values and modern solutions, and platforms like ObituaryShare are helping to bridge that gap.</p>
<p class="Body">Would you like to learn more about how digital solutions can enhance your funeral home&#8217;s services? Visit Arrington Funeral Directors&#8217; website for inspiration on meaningful obituaries or schedule a demo of ObituaryShare to see the platform in action at <a href="https://obituaryshare.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ObituaryShare.com</a></p>

<h2><strong>Balancing Empathy with Economics in Funeral Service</strong></h2>
<p>Funeral home owners face the delicate task of blending empathy with economic viability. Financial control is crucial in balancing these elements, ensuring that pricing structures are fair and transparent while supporting your business&#8217;s profitability.</p>
<h3><strong>Strategies for Balancing Empathy with Economics:</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Transparent Pricing</strong>: A key consideration would be placing your prices on your website. Also, utilizing phone shopping vendors to ensure you are not only in compliance but providing all options to families guarantees your transparency and compliance.</li>
<li><strong>Cost Management</strong>: Control expenses on essentials like caskets and services to keep operations efficient and families happy.</li>
<li><strong>Revenue Tracking</strong>: A detailed sales contract analysis ensures that you know exactly what the average sales are per case type along with the averages of the items sold within those calls. This ensures that your pricing is not only competitive, but that you&#8217;re recovering your pricing as a correlation to the average sale you&#8217;re receiving.</li>
</ul>
<p>By combining compassionate care with sound financial strategies, you can offer meaningful services while maintaining a viable business model.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>Sustaining Your Funeral Home Business</strong></h2>
<p>Effective financial control is key to sustaining a funeral service business. Strategic planning helps you adapt to market changes while honoring the emotional aspects of our profession.</p>
<h3><strong>Key Financial Strategies for Sustainability:</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Budgeting</strong>: Predictable costs ensure affordability for clients and stability for your business.</li>
<li><a href="https://files.constantcontact.com/d90f336d001/f097c1e4-7b76-427c-b3a9-2a56c1c1315b.pdf?rdr=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Financial Forecasting</strong></a>: Prepare for industry trends and future demands in your market.</li>
<li><strong>Investment in Staff Training</strong>: Enhance service quality and succession planning which fosters client trust and loyalty.</li>
</ul>
<p>A well-structured financial plan empowers your funeral home to meet customer needs with integrity, ensuring both dignified services and business longevity.</p>
<p>In Conclusion, crafting a strategic financial plan is the foundation of a thriving funeral service business. By focusing on budgeting, cash flow management, and balancing empathy with economics, funeral home owners can sustain their operations and serve their communities effectively.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>With the <a href="https://windhambrannon.com/blog/tcja-sunsetting-tax-strategy-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA)</a> provisions set to expire at the end of 2025, business owners and individuals alike face significant tax changes. These changes will affect both personal and business finances. In this Q&amp;A with the Johnson Consulting Team, we’ll explore the major tax provisions expiring and the strategies business owners should consider as the sunset of the TCJA approaches.</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<h2><strong>Q: Which major tax provisions from the TCJA are set to expire at the end of 2025?</strong></h2>
<p>A: Individuals and families can expect tax increases, but for business owners, the most concerning provisions include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Loss of the Section 199A Deduction</strong>: This deduction, currently available to pass-through entities (such as S-corporations and LLCs), allows business owners to deduct up to 20% of qualified business income. When this expires, pass-through entities will lose a valuable tax-saving tool, potentially increasing the tax burden on small businesses and entrepreneurs.</li>
<li><strong>Loss of Caps on State and Local Tax (SALT) Deductions in High-Tax States</strong>: Taxpayers in states with high income and property taxes could face higher overall tax liabilities as the current $10,000 cap on state and local tax deductions disappears.</li>
<li><strong>Reversion of Capital Gains Tax Rates</strong>: Capital gains tax rates will revert to being determined by your regular income tax bracket. This means that individuals in higher income brackets may see a significant increase in their tax rate on long-term capital gains.</li>
<li><strong>Reduction in Estate and Gift Tax Exclusion</strong>: The current estate and gift tax exclusion of $12.92 million per individual will drop by nearly 50%, meaning estates valued over approximately $6 million will be subject to estate taxes. This change could affect many families planning to transfer wealth to the next generation, making estate planning a crucial step in the coming years.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<h2><strong>Q: What tax strategies should funeral home and cemetery business owners consider as 2025 approaches?</strong></h2>
<p>A: One key strategy is to consider accelerating your income before the TCJA provisions expire. With capital gains rates set to revert to higher levels based on your income tax bracket, now is an optimal time to sell assets, take profits, or increase distributions. By doing so, you can take advantage of the lower rates now, reducing your tax liability compared to what it would be under future tax rules.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This strategy is particularly beneficial for those with capital assets such as stocks, real estate, or business interests that have appreciated significantly over time. Locking in current capital gains rates could save you a substantial amount in taxes before the rates increase post-2025.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Other considerations may be to reevaluate your business structure, either converting it to a C-Corp or an S-Corp to lessen taxes. It may also be an opportunity to increase contributions to retirement plans, investing in capital equipment, or exploring tax-advantaged benefits for employees.</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<h2><strong>The Importance of Timing in Succession Planning</strong></h2>
<p>When it comes to succession planning, the timing of a sale can have a significant impact on the value you ultimately retain. In the words of Jake Johnson, &#8220;It&#8217;s not what you get, it&#8217;s what you keep.&#8221; Even though the sale price of a business may remain the same before and after 2025, the amount you keep after taxes will change. This is due to the potential tax increases that could arise when the TCJA provisions expire.</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<h2><strong>Q: How should funeral home and cemetery business owners approaching a succession plan think about the timing of a sale?</strong></h2>
<p>A: If you&#8217;re considering <a href="https://www.johnsonconsulting.com/services/sell-my-business/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">transferring your funeral home or cemetery business</a>, now may be the optimal time to maximize the value of your business. With the potential tax increases on the horizon, selling before the end of 2025 could result in you keeping more of the proceeds.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;It’s just food for thought and something business owners should be aware of,&#8221; Jake continued. &#8220;If you were planning to sell around 2025, the tax changes might push you to reconsider your timing. Even if you’re not quite ready to sell, it’s worth considering whether selling now could help you avoid a higher tax bill later.&#8221;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The core idea is that waiting until 2026 or 2027 could mean a larger tax burden, requiring your business to make up the difference in growth or additional calls on capital. By transferring before the end of 2025, you may be able to capture a more favorable tax position and keep more of the proceeds from the sale. However, it’s important to remember that not everyone will be ready to sell at that time, so planning ahead and discussing options with a tax advisor is crucial.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In conclusion, with the expiration of these TCJA provisions on the horizon, proactive tax and succession planning are essential, working closely with a financial advisor will help you craft the best strategies to minimize your tax burden.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The satisfaction of shipping loved ones home for a funeral has seen a steady decline since 2018, even before the pandemic.(<a href="https://lp.constantcontactpages.com/su/wbJD0q4/PTX2022" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Johnson Consulting Group research Trends, and Insights see page 44</a>). According to the Wall Street Journal, it&#8217;s estimated that over 200,000 cases annually involve the transfer of a loved one over 300 miles for funeral services. This decline in satisfaction can be attributed to various factors, including the airline industry&#8217;s reduction and alteration of routes, as well as increased government red tape involving death certificates and staffing issues at health authorities.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>One potential solution to increasing satisfaction would be to have a dedicated person for shipping loved ones, but this could prove to be costly. Another approach would be to engage an experienced third-party entity experienced in shipping loved ones for ceremony. This solution involves dealing with a company that understands the intricacies of shipping within every state of the country, as well as with consulates and embassies in other countries remarks David W. McComb owner of Inman Shipping Worldwide the industry’s largest and most experienced transportation entity.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
