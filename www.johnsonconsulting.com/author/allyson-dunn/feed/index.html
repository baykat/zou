										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Providing outstanding customer service is a universal goal for businesses, but how do we truly know we’re meeting the mark? Assumptions are not enough. Instead, it requires a systematic approach to evaluate, analyze, and enhance the service we offer. Here’s a step-by-step guide to transforming your customer service process and driving continuous improvement.</p>
<h2><strong>1.The Service…Start with Self-Reflection</strong></h2>
<p>Before seeking external feedback, begin by assessing your current service delivery. This requires vulnerability—being open to recognizing shortcomings and embracing opportunities for growth. Evaluate your processes, interactions, and touchpoints. Where could improvements be made? Honest reflection sets the stage for meaningful progress.</p>
<h2><strong>2.Gather Client Feedback</strong></h2>
<p>Once you’ve acknowledged areas for improvement, the next step is to collect insights directly from your customers. <a href="https://youtu.be/UCbpHRqLhVg?si=IKAOcyZwlN-VMB4b" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Customer satisfaction surveys</a> are an excellent tool for this purpose. These can be distributed digitally (email), via text, or through traditional mail (paper).</p>
<p>Focus on these key areas:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>First Point of Contact</strong>: Often the lowest-rated section in surveys. Ask how the family’s initial interaction with your business felt and identify gaps.</li>
<li><strong>Arrangement Process</strong>: Gather feedback on the ease and efficiency of the arrangement process.  How did the arranger listen and provide the options?</li>
<li><strong>Facilities and Appearance</strong>: Evaluate impressions of your facilities, vehicles, and surroundings.  Have you provided a comfortable and quality environment for the customer.</li>
<li><strong>Service Experience</strong>: For those who utilized your service, dig deeper into their experience.</li>
</ul>
<p>Further questions should include perceptions of the overall value, how customers discovered you, their willingness to leave online reviews, and suggestions for additional services (lead generation).</p>
<h2><strong>3.Act on Feedback Quickly…Real Time Data</strong></h2>
<p>In the movie, “<em>The Godfather”</em>, bad news was expected to be delivered promptly! Similarly, receiving real-time data allows you to address issues immediately rather than letting them go unchecked.  <a href="https://www.johnsonconsulting.com/services/performance-tracker-x/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Johnson Consulting’s Performance Tracker System</a> allows you to leverage the latest technology, providing a rapid response to customer concerns.</p>
<h2><strong>4.Analyze the Data</strong></h2>
<p>Collecting feedback is only valuable if you analyze it effectively. Use robust reporting platforms to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Filter data by time frame, location, or region.</li>
<li>Identify trends and actionable insights.</li>
<li>Generate reports in real time for prompt decision-making.</li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>5.Deploy Actionable Improvements</strong></h2>
<p>With insights in hand, it’s time to implement changes. Review the data with your management team and assign tasks for execution. Ask:</p>
<ul>
<li>What improvements can we make?</li>
<li>Who will be responsible for these changes?</li>
<li>What is the timeline for implementation?</li>
</ul>
<p>Accountability and clear timelines ensure that your efforts translate into measurable results.</p>
<h2><strong>6.Invest in CX Performance Improvement</strong></h2>
<p>Customer experience (CX) isn’t a one-time fix; it requires ongoing commitment. Consider hosting <a href="https://www.johnsonconsulting.com/services/jcg-academy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Johnson Consulting’s CX performance improvement workshops</a> to bolster your service culture. John DiJulius’s book “<em><a href="https://thedijuliusgroup.com/product/the-customer-service-revolution/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Customer Service Revolution</a>”</em> is an excellent resource for understanding how to create a customer-first approach.</p>
<h2><strong>7.Generate Leads Through Exceptional Service</strong></h2>
<p>Satisfied customers naturally become ambassadors for your business. By prioritizing CX and deploying actionable improvements, you create raving fans who are eager to share their experiences. Encourage them to leave online reviews and share testimonials. This not only generates leads but also strengthens your reputation.</p>
<h2><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2>
<p>Customer service excellence is a continuous cycle. Start with honest self-assessment, gather and act on client feedback, analyze data, and implement changes. Invest in your team’s growth through CX workshops, and reap the rewards of lead generation from loyal, satisfied customers. Then, begin the process again to ensure ongoing improvement.</p>
<p>By following these steps, you’ll not only elevate your service standards but also foster a culture of excellence that drives lasting success.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Driving team member engagement is the best way to get the most out of your <a href="https://www.johnsonconsulting.com/services/performance-tracker-x/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">funeral survey program</a> and acts as powerful engine to drive performance.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Encouraging adoption by rewarding wins with some of the ideas below can get you moving in the right direction.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.johnsonconsulting.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Employee-engagement-cycle.png"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-7742 size-full" src="https://www.johnsonconsulting.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Employee-engagement-cycle.png" alt="Employee engagement cycle" width="846" height="479" srcset="https://www.johnsonconsulting.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Employee-engagement-cycle.png 846w, https://www.johnsonconsulting.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Employee-engagement-cycle-480x272.png 480w" sizes="auto, (min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 846px, 100vw" /></a></p>
<h2><strong>Incentive Compensation Plans</strong></h2>
<p>An <a href="https://www.johnsonconsulting.com/4-components-incentive-compensation-plan/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">incentive compensation plan</a> (ICP) is a form of variable compensation for your team members. A common practice is to tie the program to targeted sales, customers’ experiences, and the overall success of the organization. Incentive compensation plans can be customized to whatever metrics are important to the organization. They provide an extra dose of motivation for exceptional workplace performance and increase the chances of maintaining quality talent. Good ICPs must be understandable, fair, easily measurable, and consistent.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Without a doubt, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCbpHRqLhVg" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Performance Tracker X</a> has proved to be an important tool in easily managing ICPs. With Performance Tracker X, your team members can monitor their performance and ICP metrics in real time. This focuses their attention on the metrics that matter to you most while driving their personal growth and the growth of your organization. Increased focus increases survey communication with families which improves response rate and generates more actionable data.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td width="312">Customer Experience Metrics</td>
<td width="312">Sales Metrics Compared to Budget</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="312">&#8211;        Response rate</p>
<p>&#8211;        Collection rate</p>
<p>&#8211;        Arranger Performance Score</p>
<p>&#8211;        How quickly alerts are resolved</td>
<td width="312">&#8211;        Call volume</p>
<p>&#8211;        Average sale targets</p>
<p>&#8211;        Case mix percentage</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>Employee Recognition</strong></h2>
<p>The care, compassion, and attention your arranging directors pay to the families they serve is of the utmost importance to them and can weigh heavily. Taking the time to appreciate and recognize successes has been shown to increase productivity, comradery, culture, and loyalty to the company, leading to higher retention.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are many creative ways to accomplish this which take little time or cost.</p>
<ul>
<li>Create an internal awards program for those who had the most perfect surveys responses received, highest response rate, and/or most digital collection.</li>
<li>A monthly “spin-to-win” game with gift cards or other give aways. Add your team members name to the wheel each time a perfect score survey is received.</li>
<li>Forward a congratulatory email each time a perfect score survey is received to the whole team. This allows everyone to feel each other’s success while publicly acknowledging the arranging director.</li>
<li>Highlight an arranging director each month on your social media including some of the positive feedback left in the surveys.</li>
<li>Read the positive feedback outload during team meetings.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Giving a little can get you a lot!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>Providing clarity and setting expectations</strong></h2>
<p>It is important that your team members understand organizational goals and the part they play in achieving those goals. Team members who cannot see beyond their role often feel a reduced sense of satisfaction and fulfillment which can lead to turnover, poor relations between coworkers, and an undesirable work environment. Help your team members to understand the importance of the survey program and how it plays into your larger vision by communicating often and across multiple channels and altitudes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>People retain information differently. Some may rely heavily on verbal communication whereas others may need written information, visual aids, or even examples of the concepts in action. Repetition of the information helps to engrain the importance and communicates that the direction you are providing is here to stay. Ensure adoption at all levels of your organization by breaking down high-level concepts and explaining how they relate to your team members’ day jobs. When you pair the newfound clarity with a framework which spells out the goals or criteria which support the mission, your team members become a part of the bigger picture rather than someone who is simply affected by it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Would you like to schedule a time to discuss how to heighten engagement within your organization? Interested in an ICP in your organization? We are always here for you!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As January came to a close, we looked into the current trends shaping the satisfaction levels within funeral home and cemetery businesses for 2024. Leveraging the power of <a href="https://www.johnsonconsulting.com/services/performance-tracker-x/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Performance Tracker X</a>, our groundbreaking customer experience management tool, we&#8217;ve sent out over 13,000 surveys to collect insights into how our clients are perceived by the families they have served throughout the first month of the 2024 year.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><b>Understanding Performance Tracker X</b></h2>
