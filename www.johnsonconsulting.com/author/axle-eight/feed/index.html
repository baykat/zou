										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As Benjamin Franklin once said, “In this world, nothing is certain but death and taxes,” so if you’re looking to enter a profession, funeral homes (or accounting) might seem like a lucrative choice. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But </span><a href="http://memorials.com/info/largest-funeral-home-companies/#:~:text=Service%20Corporation%20International%20(SCI)%20is,industry%20for%20over%2050%20years" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">with large conglomerates buying up many funeral businesses</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that were once owned by families, aspiring funeral directors must ask the question: </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Is owning a funeral home profitable?</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Is Owning a Funeral Home a Profitable Business?</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As with any business, owning a funeral home can be profitable, provided you </span><a href="https://www.johnsonconsulting.com/make-your-funeral-business-more-profitable/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">practice good business habits</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Death care is also considered a recession-proof profession, as funeral home spending remains relatively constant even during times of economic downturn. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To harken back to Benjamin Franklin’s quote, people are always in need of ways to honor the passing of their loved ones. While the exact preferences in the type of memorial may fluctuate over time, the fact remains that people will always need the assistance of funeral professionals to plan services, execute burials, and aid in the grieving process. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Purchasing or Launching a New Business </span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’re considering owning a funeral home, then you’ll have two ways to enter the profession: either purchasing an existing funeral home or building a new business from scratch. </span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.johnsonconsulting.com/how-to-buy-a-funeral-home/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Buying a funeral home</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is undoubtedly the simpler and quicker option. With this approach, you’ll need to partner with an industry consultant that will help you navigate the process of finding, vetting, and negotiating the sale of the business. The primary downside of purchasing an existing business will be adapting its infrastructure (facilities, employees, and operations) to your vision. </span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.johnsonconsulting.com/diving-into-the-requirements-to-open-a-funeral-home/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Building a funeral home from scratch</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> naturally comes with a lot more work and expense, as you’ll need to purchase property, hire employees, and develop an entirely new business strategy. However, for those who are unafraid of the lengthy process, this approach can allow you to create a business that’s completely aligned with your vision. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Regardless of how you plan to start a business, professionals like those at JCG can guide you through the accompanying strategic decisions. Whether you’re building or purchasing a funeral business, financials, employee management, and marketing can all benefit from some outside help. </span></p>

<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">6 Tips for Improving Funeral Home Profits</span></h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">1. Create a Business Plan </span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the onset of creating your funeral business—whether you’re building from scratch or purchasing an existing funeral home—you’ll need to </span><a href="https://www.johnsonconsulting.com/grow-and-build-value-the-business-lifecycle-in-action/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">create a business plan</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Along with drafting a mission and your values, your business plan should also include tangible financial goals and timelines. As your funeral home continues to operate, you can reexamine these goals to better understand how you’re performing. </span></p>
<h3></h3>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">2. Marketing</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While people continually need the help of funeral homes, your business will likely not be the only option available in a given region. Because of this, you’ll need to </span><a href="https://www.johnsonconsulting.com/funeral-home-marketing-ideas/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">develop a marketing strategy</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">—one that incorporates social media, a well-designed website, and SEO practices—to ensure that your ideal families find your services and feel compelled to book. </span></p>
<h3></h3>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">3. Customer Service</span></h3>
<p><a href="https://www.johnsonconsulting.com/build-lasting-relationships-with-quality-customer-service/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Quality customer service</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is arguably the most important component of your business. If a family has a positive experience with your funeral home, then they’re not only </span><a href="https://www.johnsonconsulting.com/4-ways-to-ensure-consistent-customer-retention/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">likely to return</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, but they’ll also likely recommend your business to friends. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Because of this, funeral directors need to implement a strategy to collect and monitor feedback from families. This allows a business to quickly address issues and build upon areas of strength.  </span></p>
<h3></h3>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">4. Recruit and Retain Talent</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To create an exceptional family experience, you’ll need to </span><a href="https://www.johnsonconsulting.com/how-to-recruit-and-retain-top-talent-for-your-funeral-business/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">recruit and retain the best talent</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> available. By networking with local mortuary schools and looking to funeral profession job boards, you can find highly skilled individuals that bring value to your team. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once you’ve acquired the right people, you’ll also want to </span><a href="https://www.johnsonconsulting.com/4-components-incentive-compensation-plan/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">create incentive compensation plans</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> as well as </span><a href="https://www.johnsonconsulting.com/everything-you-need-to-know-about-jcgs-workshop-and-training-options/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">offer career development opportunities</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to ensure that personnel want to stick around. </span></p>
<h3></h3>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">5. Add New Services</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While people will always need funeral homes to help them honor the passing of loved ones, the specific ways in which they wish to accomplish this goal are subject to change. Because of this, funeral homes need to remain aware of trends and consider introducing new services into their offerings when appropriate. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, during the pandemic, in-person gatherings were impossible to conduct safely. Many funeral businesses began offering webcasted memorials in which people could remotely attend a service and pay their respects. Now, with in-person gatherings resuming, many funeral homes offer the option of adding a virtual component to a memorial service, which allows those who live far away to still attend. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Offering new products like these can put extra money in your pocket as well as demonstrate to families that </span><a href="https://www.johnsonconsulting.com/heres-what-we-can-expect-from-funeral-and-cemetery-families-in-2023/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">your funeral home is on the cutting edge</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<h3></h3>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">6. Partner with a Funeral Home Consultant</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Whether you’re purchasing a funeral business or building one from scratch, stepping into the role of business ownership is highly challenging. To ensure that you’re adeptly handling every component of the process, it’s often best to get advice from death care experts.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At </span><a href="https://www.johnsonconsulting.com/services/business-consulting/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Johnson Consulting Group</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (JCG), a leading death care consulting firm, our experts can partner with your team to help with every stage of creating a funeral business.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To have a successful funeral home, you need to get your accounting in order. Through accurate and timely financial reporting, you can not only ensure that you’re ready for tax season, but you’ll also be able to create strategic initiatives for years to come. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tidy bookkeeping requires time and attention to detail, which is why many funeral homes choose to trust a </span><a href="https://www.johnsonconsulting.com/services/accounting-financial-management/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">funeral home accounting firm like Johnson Consulting Group</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to manage the details on their behalf. Here are some actionable strategies and best practices to help you build and refine your funeral home’s financial management.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">1. Be Timely</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A fundamental component of funeral home accounting is timeliness. The sooner you start your reporting, the sooner you can start building your backlog of financial data. From this data, you can then begin to recognize patterns in revenue and expenditures.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When you have the most up-to-date financial information at your fingertips, you can make more informed decisions. For example, if you hope to make a large purchase––an expansion, perhaps––it’s essential to know exactly where your business stands financially and </span><a href="https://www.johnsonconsulting.com/the-dos-and-donts-of-budgeting-and-strategic-pricing-initiatives/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">whether or not you have the necessary budget</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Timeliness will also help you cut down on errors and omissions. If you wait to document certain financial transactions, then you’ll be more likely to forget specific circumstances and details when you move to document them.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you have a small team that already wears many hats, timeliness may be a challenge. In order to keep your bookkeeping records on track, it may make sense to </span><a href="https://www.johnsonconsulting.com/investing-in-funeral-home-accounting-services/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">invest in an accounting firm</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that specializes in deathcare to take the task off your hands.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">2. Maintain Accurate Deposit Records</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition to logging all transactions in a timely manner, it is essential for funeral homes to maintain accurate deposit records. You’ll want to get into the habit of preparing a deposit immediately after a transaction is made and ensure these deposits are properly documented. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Doing so means accounting for every dollar of incoming revenue, where it&#8217;s from, and what it was for. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is especially important for funeral businesses that work with cash transactions, as it eliminates the chance of misplacing or forgetting to enter a cash transaction. Properly tracking your revenue sources in this manner will also help protect your funeral home from fraud. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">3. Categorize Expenses Consistently</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Categorizing expenses correctly is a necessity. When it comes to expenses, take the time to properly document, track, and categorize every transaction. If you haven’t already developed a clear category structure for your expenses (chart of accounts), then you’ll want to do so immediately. Include instructions for your team that help them to distinguish between similar categories. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This includes tracking all deposits, purchases for goods and services, fees, and any other associated costs. Regularly reviewing your transactions can also help prevent surprises when tax season rolls around. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">4. Don’t Overuse the “Miscellaneous” Category</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A common mistake made by many funeral homes is over-utilizing the “miscellaneous” category. While “miscellaneous” can be a helpful utility, depending on it too much can lead to inaccurate bookkeeping and tax filing processes. If you’re labeling everything as miscellaneous, then you’re creating financial opacity for yourself down the road, making it more difficult to analyze your expenditures, not to mention capitalize on tax deductions. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Instead, you’ll want to create precise and detailed categories for each type of expenses so that you can properly track them. This also eliminates the need to try and guess the details of a specific purchase or transaction if the receipt is lost or otherwise unavailable.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">5. Link your POS and Accounting Software</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In order to maintain a comprehensive and updated view of your records, it is important to link yourcase management system and accounting software. This way, you can minimize latency between your financial tracking and reporting, saving time and reducing the risk of errors from manual data entry. However, your ability to do this may depend on the technical limitations of your </span><a href="https://www.johnsonconsulting.com/purchasing-funeral-home-accounting-software/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">funeral home accounting software</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">6. Reconcile Receivables </span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Finally, to properly manage your cash flow, it is essential to ensure that all receivables are reconciled. This means that any incoming payments are properly accounted for and recorded in the appropriate place. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Doing so allows for easy tracking of all receivables and allows your management team to better identify and avoid potential collection issues.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Funeral Home Accounting Support with JCG</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While generalized accountants are plentiful in every region of the country, only an </span><a href="https://www.johnsonconsulting.com/funeral-home-financials-hiring-the-right-accounting-firm/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">accountant with a specialization in the death care industry</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> can help you utilize the best practices of the field. A dedicated funeral home accountant can take the load off your team and ensure accurate and timely records. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At Johnson Consulting Group, our team of </span><a href="https://www.johnsonconsulting.com/services/accounting-financial-management/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">funeral home accountants</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> can help get your funeral business on track when it comes to financials.

]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Selling a funeral business is one of the most exciting times for an owner; however, it is a complex process that requires a great deal of thought and planning. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To ensure the success of the sale, there are a number of factors to consider. From setting realistic expectations to finding the right outside help, selling your funeral business is a difficult act to pull off, but if you do it right, you can guarantee that the sale sets you up for success – whether this means retirement or moving on to your next venture. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In this guide, we’ll review all the steps an owner must take from start to finish when selling a business. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Planning is Crucial</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before you start the sale process, it is important to plan ahead. Take the time to understand your business’s current financial health, market position, and future prospects. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Beyond this, you’ll also want to consider what your goals are with the sale. Are you hoping to exit a lifetime of work and retire in Florida, or are you hoping to sell the business and remain on the team in some capacity?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By planning out what your ultimate aim is, you can begin to figure out when you might sell, for how much, and to whom.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Set Realistic Goals</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As you plan, it’s important to outline realistic goals. Naturally, every owner wants to sell their funeral home for the maximum price in the shortest amount of time, but this may not always be possible, depending on the state of your business and the greater market conditions. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unlike real estate, in which homes may sell within a day of hitting the market, the death care industry is more specialized. Not just anyone can buy a funeral business, and among those individuals buying, not everyone is qualified.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By being realistic about the timeline of your sale, as well as your business’s asking price, you can prevent </span><a href="https://www.johnsonconsulting.com/regrets-selling-funeral-home/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">settling for less than you’re worth</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Valuation Package or Marketing Package?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Getting a valuation is the best way to internally understand where improvement opportunities exist for creating value. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A business valuation is an internal product and should not be shared with a potential buyer. Why? A business valuation will have a more conservative review with payroll, marketing, and other expenses that will be adjusted differently and more aggressively under a marketing package. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The sole purpose of a marketing package is to show the opportunity, minimize the risk, and create value in the business that may not exist today. For this reason, marketing packages are invaluable for business owners who are</span> <a href="https://www.johnsonconsulting.com/when-is-it-the-right-time-to-put-my-funeral-home-for-sale/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">ready to sell NOW</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Time to Create a Marketing Package</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As you begin the process of selling your business, you’ll need to get a professional marketing package created. Not only are marketing packages critical for any qualified buyer to review, but they also can give you an accurate picture of how much money you should ask for.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If the value from the marketing package doesn’t end up where you want it, then it may be best to hold off selling until you can make proper adjustments to your operations. At Johnson Consulting Group, we can help you </span><a href="https://www.johnsonconsulting.com/ive-gotten-a-valuation-now-what/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">create a post-valuation plan</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to improve your enterprise value. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Understand Tax Implications</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When selling a funeral business, it’s essential to understand the entire picture of tax implications. Particularly for those who plan to retire after a sale, it’s imperative that you account for the potentially large taxes that follow a sale. Otherwise, you might have an unpleasant surprise come tax season. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In most cases, it’s best to seek some outside help. A consultant who specializes in the funeral industry can help your tax accountant and attorney best minimize your tax burden. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Buyers Matter</span></h2>
<p><a href="https://www.johnsonconsulting.com/finding-a-business-buyer/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Finding the right buyer</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for your business can be a challenging process, one that will ultimately depend on the current state of the market as well as your ability to leverage your network. In most cases, an ideal buyer will be one already affiliated with the funeral services profession.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The funeral profession is a small network and many of the buyers are known. How you engage with those buyers depends on a well-constructed marketing package, confidentiality, and a timely process. This will ensure your success to maximize your value. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You may already have a buyer in mind, and that buyer would hope you would only talk to them. There are few buyers, if any, that would want to work with you indirectly through a broker. This is because they know they will have to pay more for the business. Ironically, all buyers would agree that a process that includes a broker is more organized, flows better, and is more timely to a close. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In summary, to maximize value, more than one buyer needs to be involved and it must be a structured process. Keep in mind that the highest price may not come from the buyer you thought would pay the most. At Johnson Consulting, we like to have 7-10 buyers involved in each marketing package. We are continually surprised by who the ultimate buyer is, as opposed to who we thought the buyer would be. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Work With Industry Experts</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Selling a business is a complex process, the success of which will drastically impact your next steps in business and life. It’s essential to seek the outside expertise needed to execute a sale right. It’s surprising to see business owners who commonly use a real estate agent to sell their home, but not using an expert to sell the most valuable asset they own — which is their funeral business. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If the industry expert does their job, they will increase the value which will accomplish two things: put extra money in the owner’s pocket and pay for the consultant without infringing on the value the owner receives. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At Johnson Consulting Group, our team of death care professionals can help you through every step of the process, from obtaining a valuation, finding a buyer, and brokering an eventual sale. With our collective decades of experience in the field, our consultants, accountants, and brokers can help you plan an exit strategy from the ground up, aligning your goals with the potential of your business. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It all starts by partnering with us. By conducting a holistic examination of your funeral home, we can help you determine where your business currently stands and what needs to be done before a sale. </span><a href="https://www.johnsonconsulting.com/contact-us/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reach out today</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to schedule a consultation.</span></p>

]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To understand the financial health of your funeral business, the right advice is essential. One of the best ways to dig deeper than surface-level numbers like profit and loss statements is by hiring an accounting firm specializing in funeral home business operations. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In this guide, we’ll discuss funeral business accounting firms and how these professionals can help drive the strategic planning of your funeral home. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Do You Need an Accounting Firm for Your Funeral Business? </span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We’ve said before that </span><a href="https://www.johnsonconsulting.com/benefits-of-hiring-a-funeral-business-consultant/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">your time as an owner is worth $1,000 per hour</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. For ownership and management to make the best decisions financially, they must have meaningful financial statements with benchmarks related to their profession.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s for this reason that funeral business accounting firms can play an essential role in your success, helping your team prepare industry-specific financial statements, provide expense benchmark guidance, and conduct bookkeeping and business consulting services. This is true for any business, especially small or family-owned businesses that may not have the staffing or expertise to dedicate the proper time to bookkeeping.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That said, a run-of-the-mill accountant may not be the most effective choice for your funeral business. An accountant with death care expertise can help you develop sound business strategies, analyze financial information, and identify areas of improvement for your business. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Understand Your Funeral Business’s Financial Health </span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are many factors that make the funeral profession unique, and the right accounting firm will know how to navigate the right path through these ins and outs. They may even be able to help you </span><a href="https://www.johnsonconsulting.com/7-strategies-to-increase-your-funeral-homes-value-over-time/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">increase your funeral home’s value over time</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by analyzing your financials and providing guidance for growth. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An accountant that specializes in funeral business accounting will have the following unique attributes:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Has a funeral business-specific chart of accounts for properly categorizing revenue and expenses</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Has an appreciation for the value of monitoring case counts, case mix, and average sales per case</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Has knowledge in reconciling and exporting out of the various case management and point-of-sale systems available to the funeral professional</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Understands the </span><a href="https://www.johnsonconsulting.com/why-its-important-to-do-a-monthly-health-check-on-your-funeral-homes-financials/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">expense and revenue benchmarks</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and percentages attributable to successful funeral homes and cemeteries </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Knows how to construct the accounting process and reporting as a management tool with guidance rather than simply just reconciling to </span><a href="https://www.johnsonconsulting.com/funeral-home-taxes/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">prepare for taxes</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> at the end of the year</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Accountants who are experienced in the funeral and cemetery profession will be better suited for providing </span><a href="https://www.johnsonconsulting.com/what-goes-into-a-funeral-home-valuation/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">valuation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and consulting guidance specific to the funeral business, unlike normal accountants.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When the time comes to </span><a href="https://www.johnsonconsulting.com/when-is-it-the-right-time-to-put-my-funeral-home-for-sale/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">sell your funeral business</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, having an experienced accountant on your team is crucial for preparing an accurate business valuation and </span><a href="https://www.johnsonconsulting.com/funeral-businesses-sale-top-ways-owners-lose-money/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">getting the most from your sale</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>

Our accounting and financial management team can help funeral businesses of any size properly manage and understand their financial records. Our accountants have a breadth of experience in the world of death care, and they are qualified to provide businesses with the advice and guidance they need to ensure their financial health. </span></p>

]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Business valuations are a crucial resource for understanding precisely how much your funeral home or cemetery business is worth. Armed with the right information and insights, you can more effectively understand your business’s positioning and plan for the rest of the year. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As we head into the second quarter of 2023, it’s essential to—if you haven’t already—obtain a valuation for your funeral business. If you’re not convinced, here are four reasons why you shouldn’t delay.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">1. Understand Your Business Health</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Most planning meetings begin by recapping prior goals and their outcomes. While there are a number of metrics that can indicate the health of your funeral business (profit and loss statements, balance sheets, employee turnover rates), </span><a href="https://www.johnsonconsulting.com/what-goes-into-a-funeral-home-valuation/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a full-fledged valuation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> takes everything into account and distills it into a number. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This number provides a top-down overview of how your business is currently performing, and it serves as the benchmark for both the near and long term.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">2. Identify Strengths and Weaknesses</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While a business valuation can be represented as a simple number, a proper valuation also includes all of the constitutive elements that lead to this number. So while your valuation will provide a benchmark of your business’s performance, one that makes it easy to compare to industry competitors, it will also provide you with an in-depth analysis of your business’s strengths and weaknesses. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A professional valuation will not only look at financial reporting, but it will also analyze many other things such as a funeral home’s management, market share, and future earnings prospects. From these more granular observations, your leadership team can determine what’s working and what could work better. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">3. Set Goals for the Year</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once you’ve thoroughly assessed the current positioning of your business, you can begin </span><a href="https://www.johnsonconsulting.com/strategic-plan/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">creating your strategic plan</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Using your valuation as the jumping-off point, you’ll create a series of objectives that aim to increase the value of your business. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, if your business is struggling with high turnover rates, you might create a plan for </span><a href="https://www.johnsonconsulting.com/how-to-recruit-and-retain-top-talent-for-your-funeral-business/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">employee recruitment and retention</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Similarly, if your sales team is struggling to fill your backlog of preneed sales, you may want to review outsourcing that functionality or what programs are being used, such as Lunch and Learns. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ultimately, all of these goals, when executed properly, will lead to a more favorable valuation. In fact, the subsequent valuation can help you evaluate the success of these initiatives.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">4. Plan Your Exit Strategy</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even if you don’t plan on selling your funeral business in the near future, it’s essential to </span><a href="https://www.johnsonconsulting.com/plan-your-exit-strategy/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">develop an exit strategy</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> as early as you can. Unless you plan on living forever, you’ll eventually need to sell your funeral business — and a business valuation is a crucial resource during the selling process.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It could take more than a year to make the proper adjustments to get your valuation in an optimal place for sale. Because of this, it’s essential to know your current valuation and how far it may fall short from your goal valuation for a sale. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Planning your succession in the funeral business can be a tricky process that often requires lawyers, brokers, accountants, and other funeral business owners. If you’re looking to learn the ins and outs of exit planning, then you should consider enrolling in the </span><a href="https://www.johnsonconsulting.com/services/jcg-academy"><span style="font-weight: 400;">JCG Academy for Leadership and Management</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Understand Your Business’s Worth with JCG</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While a simple valuation can be performed in a matter of minutes using the revenue multiple method, this shorthand valuation neglects the more nuanced components of your business and its cashflow earning potential. When it comes time to sell your business and a professional valuation is required, the resulting number will be different. Because of this, you should seek the help of experts. </span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.johnsonconsulting.com/services/valuation-services/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Johnson Consulting Group provides valuation services</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that analyze your company’s historical performance and future projections. As well as examining your company’s financial records and operational structure, JCG will also compare your business to the greater marketplace, allowing the valuation to provide you with an accurate assessment of your funeral business’s value range. In the event that the valuation comes back less than you’d anticipated, the JCG team can also provide you with </span><a href="https://www.johnsonconsulting.com/services/business-consulting/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">consulting services</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that improve your business’s value. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For funeral businesses of any size and at any stage in their life cycle, Johnson Consulting Group can help you prepare for the future, both in 2023 and beyond. </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When selling a funeral business, it’s essential to understand the concept of multiples. Represented as a numerical value, a multiple can be used to compare the values of similar businesses, and it’s also a key factor in determining the right price for a sale. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Multiples are based on a number of factors, including the specific industry as well as a business’s size and profitability. When you are considering what multiple to pay, it is the same as considering how many years of cash flow you feel confident you will receive from your purchase. It’s the number of years of cash flow you are buying.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In this guide, we’ll review the importance of multiples, how they’re assessed, and what’s considered a “good” multiple for the death care profession. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">What’s a Good Multiple When Selling a Funeral Business?</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When planning to sell your funeral business, you’ll need to </span><a href="https://www.johnsonconsulting.com/consistent-funeral-home-valuation-important/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">obtain a valuation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and during this process, the appraiser will determine a multiple range for your business. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Multiples vary greatly by industry. In the death care industry, a multiple of six to ten is considered a good range for mid-to-large size businesses. However, this multiple will vary based on factors such as the current economy, lending rates, as well as the business’s case volume, market share, and historical trends. A business’s value is dictated by the level of opportunity and risk. The higher the opportunity and the lower the risk, the higher the multiple. How you demonstrate the opportunity and the risk depends on how well your marketing package and presentation is put together. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">How Can You Improve Your Multiple?</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For many funeral business owners, improving multiples will be an essential step to take before putting a business up for sale. There are several proven ways to increase one’s multiple, and many of them dovetail with </span><a href="https://www.johnsonconsulting.com/7-strategies-to-increase-your-funeral-homes-value-over-time/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">boosting a business’s valuation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Getting Regular Valuations</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Getting regular valuations is an important step for any funeral business looking to improve its multiple. Valuations not only provide you with a top-down assessment of current performance, but they can also help identify areas of weakness in the business, which can then be addressed. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When performed annually, valuations can track the progress of a funeral business over time and help establish realistic expectations for the company’s future. We often ask how often clients look at their investments in stocks/bonds/cash, most likely they are looking on a monthly or annual basis. Funeral business owners rarely look at their own business’ value, which is ironically the most valuable asset they own. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Understand Your Financials</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While some funeral business owners can tell you how profitable their company is, fewer can readily report the deeper financial picture. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To increase a funeral home’s multiple, it’s essential for leadership to have a comprehensive understanding of the company’s current financial position and to be able to accurately interpret financial trends and performance. This includes clear and concise profit &amp; loss/income statements, and balance sheets.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Set Goals for Growth</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Setting goals for growth is also critical for improving a business’s multiple. By creating goals and executing a budget and plan to achieve them, your business can begin addressing any issues that caused it to obtain a less-than-ideal valuation. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A good place to start this process is with a </span><a href="https://www.johnsonconsulting.com/services/business-consulting/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">JCG performance analysis.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Gathering</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> key stakeholders and discussing the funeral home’s strengths and weaknesses in its </span><a href="https://www.johnsonconsulting.com/4-pillars-of-success/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">4 pillars of success</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is critical. By doing this, you can create a </span><a href="https://www.johnsonconsulting.com/strategic-plan/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">strategic plan</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that sets your business up for greater valuations.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Invest in Your Team</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Payroll is the highest expense within your company, and it’s gone up at least 5-10% of net sales in comparison to recent years. Is your labor pool an asset or liability to the business’s success in the future? Bottom line: invest in your team.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Furthermore, higher turnover rates and employee dissatisfaction can hurt your valuation. You should implement strategies to </span><a href="https://www.johnsonconsulting.com/how-to-recruit-and-retain-top-talent-for-your-funeral-business/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">recruit and retain top talent</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. In many cases, to optimize the performance of your teams, leadership may create </span><a href="https://www.johnsonconsulting.com/4-components-incentive-compensation-plan/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">incentive compensation plans</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that reward top performers within your organization.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lean on Funeral Home Consultants</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Improving the multiples of your funeral business will require extensive planning and years of execution. Your time is best suited to being active within the community and with the families you serve. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We like to say an owner’s time is worth $1000/hour….Where are you best spending your time? What are the things you should be doing, and what are the things you should be outsourcing to the experts?

]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Every funeral director knows the importance of having a website for their business; however, few leverage their websites to their full potential. As well as displaying contact information and showcasing the expertise of your staff, a funeral home website can be a valuable tool for generating revenue and selling and growing your sales. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By taking the time to create a smooth user experience and provide options for online selections, a website can become an integral source of outreach and ecommerce revenue. Here are some tips for success.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Enticing, User-Friendly Website</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Just as your grounds and facilities create a first impression for in-person clients, your website does the same for online visitors, effectively serving as your digital storefront. With this in mind, you’ll want to make sure it’s presentable. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">For starters, you’ll want to include some helpful images and videos that showcase the strengths of your funeral home. Consider including photos of your leadership and staff. You might even throw in a video walkthrough of your facilities, helping users understand how a service might look with your business. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Finally, your website should also be easy to use. This part might take some trial and error, but optimization is worth the effort. Ideally, when a user visits your website, there will be clearly displayed links to contacting your business, learning more about its history, and even selecting atneed and preneed arrangements.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Online Shopping (E-Commerce)</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Funeral services usually require in-person consultations, during at which time clients select their type of service and gain more information about pricing. However, a growing number of people </span><a href="https://maristpoll.marist.edu/wp-content/misc/usapolls/us180423_NPR/NPR_Marist%20Poll_Tables%20of%20Questions_May%202018.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">prefer to shop online</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, particularly younger generations. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To meet the needs of this type of client, your website should allow people to select services online. For example, a website built by </span><a href="https://www.funeralresultsmarketing.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Funeral Results Marketing</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is a modern, user-friendly experience that helps visitors discover your funeral home, access the information they need, and begin browsing your services.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, if a person is looking for a cremation package, they should be able to schedule and pay for it online through your </span><a href="https://www.funeralresultsmarketing.com/cremation-arrangement-websites/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">cremation arrangement website</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Alternatively, people should be able to book standardized funeral packages online when appropriate. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Particularly when it comes to selling preneed funeral arrangements, offering them online greatly increases the chances of people completing a purchase. People may not know you can pre-arrange funeral services, and displaying this option on your website can help increase the visibility of this offering.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Naturally, death care rituals require a level of individualization that’s difficult to accomplish without consultation. There’s hardly a one-size-fits-all approach to funerals; however, your online offerings can serve as base packages. Once your team makes contact with an interested family, you can then discuss additional customization options. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Transparent Pricing</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before making a purchase, the </span><a href="https://www.invoca.com/blog/retail-marketing-statistics"><span style="font-weight: 400;">vast majority of shoppers conduct research</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, including comparing prices between vendors. Because of this, it’s important to </span><a href="https://www.johnsonconsulting.com/the-dos-and-donts-of-budgeting-and-strategic-pricing-initiatives/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">display prices on your website</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When a person has no idea what they can expect to pay for a funeral service, they’re less likely to follow through and select your business. Alternatively, having a price displayed, even if it only represents a base rate, can make them feel more confident about making a purchase. Even if your website price isn’t the lowest, the act of displaying a price allows you to demonstrate your value and transparency, noting exactly what’s included with each service. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Marketing</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Your website will also play a key role in any type of </span><a href="https://www.johnsonconsulting.com/funeral-home-marketing-ideas/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">digital marketing</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. If you plan to run ads on Google, Bing, Facebook, Instagram, or other social media, they’ll inevitably link back to your website. Ideally, your ads and website will work hand-in-hand, the former directing them to your site and the latter compelling them to select a service. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Additionally, your website can organically gain traffic by targeting relevant keywords. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Use your site&#8217;s blog section to create informative and useful content about death care. Your site will begin to rank more highly in online searches, ultimately increasing your business&#8217; visibility and customer base. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Consultation Services with JCG</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Managing a website can easily become a full-time job. After all, many larger businesses devote entire teams to building and overseeing their web presence. For smaller businesses, particularly those new to the world of digital marketing, it’s often helpful to rely on the expertise of consultants. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At Johnson Consulting Group (JCG), our team of death care consultants can partner with your business to </span><a href="https://www.johnsonconsulting.com/services/business-consulting/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">create a holistic marketing strategy</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, one that helps you build a website that drives e-commerce. With years of experience helping funeral businesses of all sizes, our team is familiar with industry-wide best practices and can help you implement them in your own marketing practice. </span></p>

]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When your team is engaged with their work, they’re more likely to be productive and dedicated to providing quality customer service. However, according to Gallup’s </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">State of the Global Workplace </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">report, 85% of employees are either </span><a href="https://www.gallup.com/workplace/231668/dismal-employee-engagement-sign-global-mismanagement.aspx"><span style="font-weight: 400;">not engaged or actively disengaged</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> with their work. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While there are a variety of ways to engage the staff of your funeral home — incentive compensation, robust benefits, and growth opportunities, to name a few — no two team members desire the exact same things. To better understand how to </span><a href="https://www.johnsonconsulting.com/employee-engagement/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">engage your teams</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, leadership must regularly meet with their staff. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By creating a schedule of informal check-ins combined with more thorough quarterly and annual assessments, managers can better understand their employees and how to engage them most effectively. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">One-on-one Meetings</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Funeral home leadership should set aside time for casual, one-on-one meetings with each of their team members. Occurring on either a weekly or bi-weekly basis, these meetings offer managers the chance to check in with their team members on both the personal and professional levels. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unlike more formal review-based meetings, weekly one-on-one sessions allow team members to express how they’re doing, what’s currently going well, and what they might be struggling with. This information is valuable for leaders as it can alert them to potentially larger issues before they affect the business. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s important to note that this one-on-one shouldn’t feel like a laundry list of tasks for the employee to complete. Rather, it’s a time to check in and address any issues that might be holding them back in the short and long term. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Quarterly Check-in</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While similar to weekly one-on-one meetings, quarterly check-ins require a bit more preparation, and they should be primarily focused on team member goals and their progress. To start off, managers should ask about each goal of the team member. These goals may be related to numbers, or they might consist of personal development. Regardless, managers should use this time to get up to speed on each team member’s status. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once updated, managers can then dig deeper and figure out what’s going well for the employee and what challenges are holding them back. This allows managers to adjust goals effectively and offer assistance as needed. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Annual Review</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The most formal variety of meetings, </span><a href="https://www.johnsonconsulting.com/annual-reviews-the-ultimate-staff-evaluation-checklist/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">annual reviews</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> should begin with written evaluations of the employee, both from the employee themself and from their direct manager. Once this information has been collected, both team members can use it as a jumping-off point for discussion, running through each goal, success, and challenge of the team member over the last year. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During the performance review, managers should remind employees that these sessions are two-way conversations. If a manager notes that an employee struggled with a component of their role, an employer should feel comfortable to honestly express what contributed to this struggle. This way, both personnel can discuss the ways in which these issues can be addressed in the coming year. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Overall, annual reviews should be future-focused. Through the process of retrospectively reviewing a team member’s performance, managers should help them build new goals for the coming year, goals that both challenge their strengths and encourage them to grow in areas of struggle. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Develop Your Team with JCG</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Regular meetings help you stay in touch with employee strengths, needs, and struggles. By using these meetings to inform your managerial practice, you can improve engagement and retention in the long run. While much can be done to engage employees by increasing pay and providing on-the-job training, in many cases, team members can benefit from outside learning. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Top-performing employees are often rewarded with increased responsibilities and pay. To make sure these growing employees have the skills they need to do the job right, you can look to the help of outside funeral home training courses. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Offered through Johnson Consulting Group, a leading funeral home consulting firm, </span><a href="https://www.johnsonconsulting.com/services/jcg-academy/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">JCG Academy</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> helps equip death care professionals with industry-leading tactics. Currently, our consulting firm offers </span><a href="https://www.johnsonconsulting.com/everything-you-need-to-know-about-jcgs-workshop-and-training-options/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">courses in leadership and customer experience</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Led by experienced death care consultants, these courses augment employees’ skill sets.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By meeting regularly with your employees, you’ll gain a thorough understanding of how they perform and how they’d like to grow. In many cases, this growth requires some outside help, making JCG Academy a great way to refine your employees’ approach to work. </span><a href="https://www.johnsonconsulting.com/contact-us/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Contact us today</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to learn more.</span></p>

]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bookending each year of business, performance reviews allow employees and leaders to connect, reflect, and plan for the future. Naturally, a significant component of performance management meetings will be constructive feedback; however, managers should also focus on several additional elements. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By taking the time to not only critique employees but also listen to them, engage them, and create collaborative goals, leaders can ensure that performance management meetings become a cornerstone of their management strategy.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">1. Preparation</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before entering a performance review meeting, managers should examine an employee’s previous performance reviews. Within these reviews, you’ll find a comprehensive look at an employee’s strengths, weaknesses, successes, and drawbacks, as well as their goals for the future. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During the impending review, managers should use prior reviews in order to contextualize an employee’s current performance. For example, suppose a prior review indicated that a funeral director aimed to improve their satisfaction rating from families. You can use this information in the new review to understand whether or not they achieved this goal.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">2. Reflection</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the employee’s end, employees should be asked to review themselves before engaging in a formal review. In this type of self-evaluation, an employee will return to their prior reviews, take a look at the goals they’d set for themselves, and assess how they performed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During the present review, managers should refer to these self-evaluations as the foundation of discussion. When an employee notes that they’ve reached a goal, leadership can applaud them, as well as discuss what actions the employee took to achieve said result. Alternatively, if an employee acknowledges that they’ve failed to achieve a goal, a manager can discuss how this can be improved in the future, setting goals accordingly.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">3. Active Listening</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ultimately, the goal of any performance review is to better understand how team members work, how they currently excel, and how they stand to grow. Because of this, managers need to create an atmosphere of empathy and trust. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Employees should not fear that admitting to a shortcoming will result in their termination or demotion; rather, they should trust that their manager listens to their experience. If team members feel comfortable expressing their weaknesses honestly, then managers can help them practice new skills to overcome any relevant obstacles. Growth mapping in this manner is one of the best ways to </span><a href="https://www.johnsonconsulting.com/employee-engagement/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">engage employees</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">4. Transparency</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Honest communication is crucial to any performance review, and this is just as important for both the employee and the manager. Both participants should speak honestly about the employee’s performance. This provides the basis for discussion.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If a manager feels that a team member could perform more effectively, they should state this, albeit compassionately. In response to this honest feedback, an employee may agree, disagree, or even ask clarifying questions. Ideally, at the end of the review, an employee and manager are on the same page in terms of current performance and subsequent steps. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">5. Goal-Setting</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Based on the collaborative assessment of an employee, both an employee and manager can work together to create goals for the upcoming year. In most cases, an employee will need several sets of goals that play to their current strengths and challenge them to work on their shortcomings. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By articulating these goals in a formal manner, managers can realign with their team members and ensure that they’re on the same page with company-wide goals.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">6. Action</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">No goal is complete without accompanying actions and KPIs (Key Performance Indicator). If an employee aims to increase their preneed sales, then they will need to settle on a tangible number of sales within a certain timeframe. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For goals that are more difficult to measure––for example, refining one’s leadership practice––managers might consider </span><a href="https://www.johnsonconsulting.com/why-its-so-important-to-keep-learning-in-funeral-service/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">career development opportunities</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, calling on outside assistance to boost the skill sets of their teams. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Develop your Team with JCG Academy</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While many death care skills, particularly those for younger employees, can be learned on the job from senior team members, employees with more experience should still be given opportunities to grow. For these team members, it’s often helpful to call on those with professional development expertise. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Johnson Consulting Group, a leader in death care consulting, offers a professional development service, </span><a href="https://www.johnsonconsulting.com/services/jcg-academy/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">JCG Academy</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Administered by JCG’s consultants, JCG Academy courses can help your teams with leadership, management, and customer service skills. The consultants at JCG Academy possess a wealth of experience working with death care businesses of all sizes, and they can help your team stay up to date on the best practices in the industry. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Performance management meetings help employees realign with the goals of their teams at large, setting initiatives for the coming year and planning for growth. If you’re looking to fast-track your employees’ growth, then JCG Academy courses can help refine the existing skills of your teams. </span></p>

]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For any funeral home looking to grow, strategic planning is a crucial piece of the puzzle. Rather than get caught up in the urgency of day-to-day operations, strategic planning is an opportunity for leadership to focus on the projects that will lead to long-term success.</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">That said, it’s not a challenge you can leap into unprepared. If you want your long-term growth plan to succeed, strategic planning is a crucial step of the process. You must establish precise goals, assess your business’s capabilities, and decide on the best path forward. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Having this plan in place can help you better understand what your funeral home is capable of and avoid costly, ineffective initiatives that only serve to stress your team. When setting out to craft a strategic plan for the upcoming years, here’s what you should consider.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2></h2>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Define Success</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When strategizing key company initiatives in your funeral home, start by defining the end goal. By beginning with the end in mind, it’s easier to plan ahead and effectively allocate the resources required.</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Are you looking to grow your funeral home business profits? Do you struggle with staff turnover and want to create a better culture to </span><a href="https://www.johnsonconsulting.com/how-to-recruit-and-retain-top-talent-for-your-funeral-business/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">attract and retain talent</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">? Or perhaps you’re interested in </span><a href="https://www.johnsonconsulting.com/the-funeral-business-lifecycle-exit-phase/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">exit planning</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and want to get the business in a good place before selling it. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Evaluate the Prior Year </span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once you’ve decided on a company initiative, whether it is introducing new services or optimizing an existing process, the next step is to understand where you are currently and where you’ve been in the past year.</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Take some time to reflect and collect feedback from your team. Explore questions like: </span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">What went right?</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">What went wrong? What did we learn from these failures?</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">What are the biggest opportunities in front of us?</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">What are the biggest current challenges we face?</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Where do we want the company to be three years from now?</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At Johnson Consulting Group, we send our clients a pre-work questionnaire that includes questions like this and more. The questionnaire is completely anonymous and serves as a crucial starting point as we craft a strategic plan for our clients. By consolidating the answers into a workbook, we can gather insight into a client’s starting position and better advise them going forward. </span></p>

<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Analyze the Situation and Establish Key Company Outcomes</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once you have a better understanding of your previous year, it’s time to perform a SWOT analysis. Performing a </span><a href="https://www.johnsonconsulting.com/neglecting-a-swot-analysis-dont-do-it-heres-why/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">SWOT analysis on a regular basis</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is a powerful way to keep track of your funeral home’s health as a business. </span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">SWOT stands for Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, and Threats. Your funeral home can use a SWOT analysis to assess internal operations and how you stand up to competitors, which helps the leadership team understand where the company is currently positioned.</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">From there, you can decide what outcomes you’d like to see for your funeral home. This could be any number of things, such as improving the family experience, increasing preneed sales, or expanding to a second location.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Choose a Key Company Initiative</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now that you have a foundational understanding of your business’s capabilities, it’s time to choose Key Company Initiatives (KCI). Your team likely has many wonderful ideas, so this is an excellent time to analyze and vet each option before choosing which ones to focus on first.</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">This consists of three steps:</span><b></b></p>
<h3>Development</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Brainstorm a list of possible KCIs that could achieve the outcome you want. Include everyone during this process, as it will help identify everyone’s perspective.</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">When we work with clients, a JCG facilitator will go around the room and gather each person’s thoughts on what is the most important initiative to work on first. Each member of the team will have a unique perspective to offer, which can provide valuable insight during the process. </span> <b></b></p>
<h3>Evaluation</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After gathering a list of possible initiatives, break down each initiative into more precise components. This will help your team understand how feasible the initiative is as far as budget, current staffing, and other available resources.</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Name of initiative</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> &#8211; Define what the project is and what it will involve.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Owner</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> &#8211; List who will spearhead the initiative. This person does not necessarily have to execute on every step, but they are the main point of contact.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Definition of success</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> &#8211; What is the goal? Establish what your team hopes to achieve as a result of the new initiative.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Milestones and timeline</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> &#8211; Look ahead at your end goal, then break down the smaller steps necessary to get there.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Key performance indicators (KPIs) and metrics</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> &#8211; Discuss how you will measure the success of the initiative using specific KPIs. You should gather metrics before, during, and after launching the initiative.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Resources and support </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8211; Compile a list of resources your team can go to for more information. This might include consultants, market data, competitive research, and more.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As the funeral home manager or director, it will be your job to divvy up ownership and individual tasks according to your team’s strengths and availability. If we take the example of increasing preneed sales, you might want to appoint a lead sales agent for the initiative who can administer the training and report back to you on progress.</span><b></b></p>
<h3>Prioritization</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once you’ve finished establishing the components for each KCI, it’s time to narrow down your list and decide which initiative to tackle first.</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, remodeling your funeral home facilities might be a KCI you have in mind to improve the customer experience. However, if you lack the cash flow to comfortably budget for the project, you might decide it will take a lower priority on your list. </span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Where initiatives typically fail is when decision-makers don&#8217;t have all the necessary perspectives required to achieve the proper timeline or result. If your team rushes through the development, evaluation, and prioritization of a KCI, your team may struggle to achieve the desired outcome and waste budget and energy in the process.</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, the funeral home owner may prioritize their own ideas rather than take the time to gather the insight and perspective of their team. They might not understand how much time is wasted while waiting for outdated software or a slow network to load. This could directly clash with a KCI to improve the customer experience by adding an online chat to the website. </span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">This is where an outside facilitator, such as the experts at JCG, can be extremely helpful. We can offer funeral directors a fresh, unbiased perspective of the business and a strategic path forward.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2></h2>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Monitor the Progress</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As you proceed through the steps of your plan, be ready and available to address issues that come up. In many cases, it will become necessary to adjust the budget. You should be prepared to do so, provided your point person has a thorough justification for said moves. </span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">You should also not be afraid to delegate or reassign work as needed. As frequently as possible, keep in touch with your leadership team to communicate any progress and setbacks. </span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Accountability is a crucial part of the process, too. Management should regularly check in with the initiative owner, and the initiative owner should check in with any staff they are managing during the rollout. Estimates for budget and timeline are just that — estimates — so it’s likely they will differ from the final result. Accountability meetings can help leadership evaluate whether the initiative is on track and make adjustments as needed.</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Generally, it’s best to hold this accountability meeting every 90 days. During the review, recognize successes and wins of the initiative as well as any challenges or concerns. This is also a good time to check if employees are hitting any barriers that are holding them back from success. </span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">During our strategic plan accountability meetings with clients, we also ask the questions: What went right? What went wrong? What did we learn?</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Questions like these will help you determine how to work more effectively. While each of your initiatives will differ in nature and scope, your business can continually improve the way you plan for and approach new initiatives. </span></p>
