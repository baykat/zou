										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We recently conducted a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyP1mZeqe_4&amp;t=45s" target="_blank" rel="noopener">comprehensive webinar</a> delving into the intricacies of the FTC Funeral Rule, featuring our experts Nelson Thulin from Johnson Consulting Group, and  Poul Lemaster and Nicole Wiedeman from </span><a href="https://www.deadringers.co/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dead Ringers</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. During the session, you had the opportunity to pose questions, and we&#8217;re here with the answers. Here is a breakdown of the most frequently asked-about topics: </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><b>Inclusion Clarification</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Utilizing &#8220;INCL&#8221; on pre-arrangement agreements is permissible under FTC guidelines, provided it&#8217;s transparent to all parties involved. While the FTC allows this shorthand, it&#8217;s considered best practice to itemize each component within a package for clarity and ease of understanding, ensuring transparency for families.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><b>Internet Policies and Pricing Creativity</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Presently, aside from California, there are no mandatory internet posting requirements for funeral homes. However, it&#8217;s anticipated that all price lists may eventually need to be published online, pending further directives from the FTC. As for innovative approaches to presenting pricing, success lies in transparently showcasing value to consumers, emphasizing that value doesn&#8217;t solely equate to lower costs.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><b>Managing &#8220;Inc.&#8221; Items and Identifying Junk Fees</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Clear identification of each selected item, even if part of a package, is advisable to address potential future discrepancies. &#8220;Junk fees,&#8221; as defined by the FTC, encompass hidden charges that can detrimentally impact consumers. Examples include last-minute fees for event tickets or undisclosed resort fees at hotels.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><b>Resource Link for Funeral Rule Compliance</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For funeral home staff seeking guidance on adhering to the Funeral Rule, the FTC provides an online download of the &#8220;Complying with the Funeral Rule&#8221; booklet. You can access it via this link:</span><a href="https://www.ftc.gov/system/files/documents/plain-language/565a-complying-with-funeral-rule_2020_march_508.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">FTC Funeral Rule Compliance Guide</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><b>Direct Cremation Inquiry Handling</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When fielding inquiries about direct cremation, it&#8217;s essential to communicate your pricing range, inclusive of options where the funeral home provides the alternative container and scenarios where the consumer may opt to provide their own. Referring to the FTC guidelines, an alternative container is described as enclosing the body and can be constructed from materials such as fiberboard or composition materials. A suggested approach for explaining your offerings might be: &#8220;Our direct cremation prices range from x to y, encompassing various container options. The alternative container we provide is cardboard, though we have other options available. Would you like to explore additional pricing choices with different containers?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By adhering to these practices and leveraging available resources, funeral homes can navigate the complexities of the Funeral Rule while providing clarity and value to their clientele. We will continue to keep the profession updated on the latest FTC rulings and best practices as they finalize. Contact our team with any questions. </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Succession planning sounds simple but in reality it is a particularly challenging process. For many funeral and cemetery business owners, choosing a suitable successor to take over their most valuable asset is a significant lifetime event that should be carefully managed. There can be unexpected pitfalls and obstacles along the way, and funeral professionals need to have a well thought out plan in order to be successful at succession planning. Here are the Top 7 mistakes of succession planning we have seen over the years.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>#1: Lack of Preparation</h2>
<p>Succession planning is not a spur of the moment event. Some funeral owners put off preparing a succession plan until a major event forces them to consider a transfer or an outright sale. However, good preparation is essential as there are many factors to consider when planning the future of your business, even if it’s not something that is currently on your radar. Owners need to evaluate the competitive landscape, future cash needs, market demographics, industry trends, and the strengths and weaknesses of potential successors.</p>
<p>Funeral home owners should also take into account their age and overall enjoyment of the work. For instance, at 40 &#8211; 50-years-old you may not be interested in doing a succession plan but should definitely think about future planning, whereas if you are in your 60’s or 70’s and don’t yet have a succession plan, you should start working on one as soon as possible. Remember, having a succession plan does not mean you have to implement it; the important thing is having a complete plan ready to go.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>#2: The DIY Approach</h2>
<p>Many funeral owners try to prepare a succession plan on their own but this do-it-yourself approach is not the right way to go when it comes to succession planning. Your local accountant or attorney may be able to provide limited assistance, but you should engage an industry expert who can effectively guide you through the entire process. It helps to get support from someone who understands the dynamics of the funeral industry and can provide an objective assessment of the true value of your firm. Make sure you engage the right group of professionals to optimize your succession planning experience.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>#3: Incorrect Estimates</h2>
<p>In order to define the real value of your funeral home holdings, you need an expert with experience in the field to give you an accurate determination of what your business is really worth. Getting an independent business valuation based on industry and competitor benchmarks can define the financial health of your operations, increase the value of your holdings and help you navigate the transfer of your business. This is what succession planning is all about: understanding what your value is today and then putting a plan in place to enhance your future value. This is why it&#8217;s so important to get an <a href="https://www.johnsonconsulting.com/5-reasons-why-you-should-get-a-business-valuation-every-year/">annual valuation</a> for your business.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>#4: Short-Term Thinking</h2>
<p>Succession plans should include both short-term and long-term goals because there’s more to the process than just signing on the dotted line. Funeral home owners need to decide on whether they want to maximize cash received from a transfer, or if they prefer a steady stream of cash flow in future years. A key piece of the puzzle involves the tax ramifications of a business transfer. You have probably heard the saying “It is not what you sell for, it is what you put in your pocket” — what this means is that your tax situation is an important part of the ownership transfer process and ignoring this piece of the puzzle can have negative results after the fact.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>#5: Choosing the Wrong Plan</h2>
<p>One question you must ask yourself is what type of succession plan you want — family, employee, or outright sale:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Family</strong> – if you have family members interested in taking over the business, it makes sense to include them in your succession plan. If the family member doesn’t have the financial capability to complete the transfer, an SBA lender or your local bank may be able to assist. In many cases the funeral owner steps in personally with financing via a subordinated note.</li>
<li><strong>Employee</strong> – a key employee may be the right person to carry on your legacy. Once again, financing may be an issue but the same options for a family transfer are also available in this case (outside/owner financing).</li>
<li><strong>Outright Sale</strong> – if your family members and employees aren’t interested in taking over the business, you should consider an outright sale. In this situation, financing is not an issue as most industry buyers have enough cash to buy your firm, however finding a buyer who is a good fit is essential to generating maximum value from a sale.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>#6: High Expectations</h2>
<p>Some funeral home owners have an unrealistic idea of the value of their firm. They remember the good old days when purchase price multiples were very high, and incorrectly apply those numbers to their current situation. This mind-set is hard to change, because a thorough <a href="https://www.johnsonconsulting.com/contact-us/">business valuation</a> is necessary for succession planning and it entails a lot of work that can disrupt day-to-day operations. In the end, the final result may not be even close to what the owner is expecting. Nonetheless, you must first find out the true value of the business when developing a succession plan, and then move forward from there.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>#7: Waiting Too Long</h2>
<p>This is perhaps the biggest mistake we see with succession planning. Funeral home owners need to start early and analyze every aspect of their business, including current market trends, number of families served each year, the business mix, revenues and free cash flow. If any of these features are declining, then your company’s value is probably declining as well. Evaluate your overall position and see if you can correct the issues that need fixing and get your firm back on track. <a href="https://www.johnsonconsulting.com/services/business-consulting/">A JCG industry expert</a> can provide guidance on how to change negative trends and improve performance. Whatever you do, don’t let your business continue to deteriorate as this will only weaken your succession planning value proposition.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 500; color: #000000;">What makes a funeral home exemplary? The funeral profession is filled to the brim with multiple players, but as in any competitive field, only a few businesses rise to the top. These funeral homes embody certain characteristics that elevate them above the competition. Here are the top three components of exceptional funeral homes.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 500;">Owners Who Go Above and Beyond </span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 500; color: #000000;">Paying attention to the details is expected in the funeral profession, but funeral homes that consistently go above and beyond to meet the needs of bereaved families stand out from the rest. Personalized care is crucial, and even the smallest detail matters to a funeral owner committed to providing the highest level of customer service. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 500; color: #000000;">Certain funeral professionals make every effort to help their customers, whether it’s by providing support and comfort to family members whenever they need it, or by organizing a personalized and memorable tribute to a loved one. There are many heartwarming examples that illustrate this approach, such as the funeral director in Elgin, IL who generously volunteered his time and money to plan a community service for a fellow veteran who had been homeless. There’s also a team at Lucas Funeral Homes in Hurst, TX who arranged a Superman-themed funeral service for a young boy, and wore Superman shirts beneath their suits in honor of the beloved young fan. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 500; color: #000000;">These acts of kindness leave a lasting impression in the community. Grieving families truly appreciate the support and often share their gratitude through positive word of mouth and online reviews. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 500;">Professional and Compassionate Employees </span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 500; color: #000000;">People are the most important asset of any funeral business. Your team must be professional, compassionate and sincere at all times because the success of your business depends on their ability to deliver consummate care. These qualities are essential for both full-time and part-time employees, who should come across as authentic and attentive to families and colleagues alike. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 500; color: #000000;">Exemplary funeral homes build strong teams by investing in their people and offering continuous opportunities for training and advancement. Creating a sense of belonging and a unique company culture encourages staff to remain loyal and dedicated to their employer. Your people should be happy to be part of your funeral home — employee buy-in is key to workplace engagement, and engaged employees desire to do good work and maintain a strong reputation within the community. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 500; color: #000000;">Other methods a funeral owner can use to boost employee satisfaction is to lead by example and maintain an open door policy so that staff feel comfortable coming to you with questions. Always be open to suggestions for improvement — funeral owners who listen to their employees are rewarded with high-performing workers. Lastly, make sure your operational processes and service standards are well-documented and clearly communicate your performance expectations to your team so that everyone is on the same page.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 500;">Staying Relevant </span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 500; color: #000000;">Many funeral homes pass down ownership from one generation to the next, which can sometimes lead to old-fashioned thinking. Exemplary funeral homes embrace change and keep up with current trends by creating new offerings that appeal to their families. Funeral directors can gain insight into what families want by conducting surveys within their community and using the resulting feedback to implement changes to their products and services. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 500; color: #000000;">The general look and feel of a funeral home is also important. Your facility must be clean and updated, and each room should cater to the needs of potential customers. For example, providing a coffee kiosk, a cozy sitting area, or a fun kids room can go a long way to making people feel welcome in your funeral home. More and more families are interested in personalized funerals and celebration of life events, which often require contemporary spaces that can accommodate these types of services. Funeral homes should refresh their decor and open up their facility layout in order to compete with restaurants and event halls in this regard. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 500; color: #000000;">To reach the highest rank of exemplary funeral homes, you must possess these three components and continuously work to improve your service offerings and deliver unmatched customer service to families. </span><a href="https://www.johnsonconsulting.com/contact/"><span style="font-weight: 500;">Contact the Johnson Consulting Group</span></a><span style="font-weight: 500; color: #000000;"> management team to find out how we can help you achieve your performance goals.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 500; color: #000000;">At Johnson Consulting Group, the personal and financial success of funeral and cemetery professionals has always been our top priority. We understand that funeral service is of the utmost importance to our clients, which makes it just as important for our team. The COVID-19 crisis has had a significant impact on the funeral profession, and we are proud to offer our unwavering support during these tough times.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 500;">COVID-19 Crisis Response Fund</span></h2>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-weight: 500;">The Memorial Classic, headed by </span><span style="font-weight: 500;">Tom and Jake Johnson</span><span style="font-weight: 500;"> of Johnson Consulting Group, recently contributed $30,000 to the Funeral Service Foundation to help fund the</span></span><a href="https://www.funeralservicefoundation.org/covid19fund/"> <span style="font-weight: 500;">COVID-19 Crisis Response Fund</span></a><span style="font-weight: 500; color: #000000;"> for emergency assistance and grief support. The Funeral Service Foundation has served as the funeral profession’s philanthropic voice since 1945, building meaningful relationships with families and communities and offering compassionate care no matter the circumstances.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 500; color: #000000;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 500; color: #000000;">The Foundation created the fund as a timely response to the COVID-19 situation, and the program provides various grants:</span></p>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 500;"><span style="font-weight: 500; color: #000000;">For immediate needs within funeral service including emergency response to significant loss of life.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 500;"><span style="font-weight: 500; color: #000000;">To organizations providing services and resources to families with unresolved and complicated grief due to loss during this crisis.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 500;"><span style="font-weight: 500; color: #000000;">For other important needs as funeral service continues to serve families during this rapidly evolving crisis.</span></li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: 500; color: #000000;">“As long-time advocates of the Foundation we know that it’s even more important to give our full support during this very unique and challenging time,” said Tom Johnson (Founder of Johnson Consulting Group). JCG routinely donates to the Funeral Service Foundation’s annual Memorial Classic, but even though the event did not take place this year The Memorial Classic continues to be a strong ally of the Foundation.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 500;">Pillars of Support</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 500; color: #000000;">The COVID-19 Crisis Response Fund is designed to be flexible, and grant funding is available for US and Canadian nonprofits as well as funeral homes and funeral service-related businesses working in conjunction with an exempt organization which agrees to serve as the fiscal agent for the grant. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 500; color: #000000;">Funding priorities for emergency assistance include helping funeral homes secure personal protective equipment (PPE) supplies and reimbursements for volunteers traveling to help funeral directors in “hot spot” regions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 500; color: #000000;">The Funeral Service Foundation is also focused on providing support for families coping with delayed or complicated grief. Grief is a unique and personal experience and we all grieve in our own way, however grieving the loss of a family member or a close friend during the 2020 pandemic has been particularly difficult. The Response Fund addresses this need by offering grief guides that detail the challenges of grieving a loved one alone and apart from family and friends (guides are available in English and Spanish). Mental health services are also available for funeral service professionals who are overworked and/or stressed from dealing with the public health crisis.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 500; color: #000000;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 500; color: #000000;">“What a gift of this size means, especially in a year when the event was cancelled really speaks to [the Memorial Classic’s] ongoing commitment to the funeral profession and the Foundation,” said Lee Wiensch, Executive Director of the Funeral Service Foundation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 500; color: #000000;">Wiensch continued by saying that “(they) have been long time and giant supporters and we are so grateful for [their] gifts over time. [Their] gift this year means a lot especially during a difficult time. It helps us respond meaningfully to the COVID-19 crisis and continues to provide scholarships and the sorts of programs that funeral professionals need from the Foundation.”</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 500;"> </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 500;">Created for Partnership</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 500; color: #000000;">The Memorial Classic and Johnson Consulting Group are both proud to partner with the Funeral Service Foundation in responding meaningfully to the COVID-19 crisis. “It&#8217;s our privilege to work with such a vital group of individuals and we are excited to continue our support of the Foundation and its mission for years to come,” said Jake Johnson (President/CEO).  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 500;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 500; color: #000000;">The Funeral Service foundation created a Thank You video for Tom and Jake Johnson’s contributions to the COVID-19 relief found.

]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: #000000;">The initial contact with a family made to a funeral home or cemetery is always the most important touchpoint. The first time you speak with a customer, whether on the phone or when they arrive at your place of business, it is crucial to set the right tone for future conversations, and it also plays a significant role in the family’s overall satisfaction and experience with your business. As the saying goes, “You never get a second chance to make a first impression.”</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">The loss of a loved one is a tragic event, and when families take the first step towards making funeral, cremation or burial arrangements, they expect to be treated with respect, compassion, and care. Your funeral home’s reputation depends on whether or not the level of service they receive during the initial contact phase effectively meets their needs and expectations. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">A mishandled call can easily lead to lost business and/or negative reviews. Survey insights from the Johnson Consulting Group’s</span> <a href="https://www.johnsonconsulting.com/services/performance-tracker/">Performance Tracker</a> <span style="color: #000000;">program demonstrate that when families are asked to rate specific touchpoints of their funeral or cemetery experience, the lowest satisfaction ratings are associated with unsatisfactory initial phone calls or impersonal and unprofessional first interactions. It’s vital that funeral and cemetery providers ensure families receive the highest standard of service when they place that first call. Here are some ideas to help you improve and enhance a family’s initial experience with your firm.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2></h2>
<h2><strong>Perfect the Tone </strong></h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">The person who (receives) answers the initial call must employ the right tone. Voice and tone differ in that while a person’s voice sounds more or less the same on a daily basis, their tone often changes depending on the situation. Train your staff to sound sympathetic, patient and kind when they take a family’s first call, and ask them to listen carefully to the caller’s words (both said and unsaid). It’s not just about what you say, it’s also about <i>how</i> you say it. Empathy and attentiveness go a long way towards making the right first impression for your funeral home or cemetery.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2></h2>
<h2><strong>Clear Communication</strong></h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">The content discussed during the initial conversation is also important. Make sure that all the necessary information a bereaved family needs to know is clearly communicated and that they understand exactly how you will help them and what happens next and what to expect in the process moving forward. As you describe your services, be informative and concise trying not to focus too much on service costs and minute details. Keep in mind that the priority is to listen to the caller’s questions and respond in a professional and kind (empathetic) manner. Let them know you care about their situation, and provide them with a clear plan and the need-to-know essentials. In addition, repeat any names or numbers you write down, verifying spelling to ensure the information is accurate — this shows that you are listening and truly care about the family’s concerns. It is also a good way to prevent unnecessary mistakes down the line.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2></h2>
<h2><strong>Manage Calls Efficiently</strong></h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">If your funeral home or cemetery uses an answering service to take calls, make sure they follow an established script based on your guidelines for customer contact. Work with the dedicated call center to manage incoming calls for your business efficiently by distinguishing between the all-important family calls which are top priority, and non-urgent calls such as calls for directions, facility information, etc. The answering service represents an extension of your business, and should maintain efficiency to ensure the first conversation is always compassionate and professional.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2></h2>
<h2><strong>Return Calls ASAP</strong></h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">In some cases you might miss the initial call from a family member or perhaps your answering service doesn’t relay the message in a timely fashion. If that happens, make sure you return the call as soon as possible. Delays in returning phone calls or following up with families is often cited as a reason for average or below average satisfaction with a funeral or cemetery business. A quick response is especially important for at-need calls as this shows you are competent, efficient and ready to serve. It’s ok if you don’t have the answer the family needs or the information they are expecting, however, a prompt and proactive call to provide them with an update will be appreciated and will demonstrate your passion for high quality service.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2></h2>
<h2><strong>Always Follow Up</strong></h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">The first call is a critical phase of a family’s initial contact with a funeral home or cemetery, but what happens afterwards is also significant. Always follow up with a professional email thanking the family for calling you in their time of need and offering helpful advice on how to prepare for the arrangement conference. You can provide the family member(s) a list of documents to collect in advance and guide them to other useful sources of information (preferably on your website or Facebook business page). A detailed follow-up email emphasizes your commitment and concern, and lets the family know they made the right decision in choosing your funeral home or cemetery business.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">A family’s satisfaction with your funeral home or cemetery’s services is directly linked to their first interaction with you and your staff. Johnson Consulting Group can assist your firm in developing a customer experience strategy and provide you with the tools to measure the overall customer service levels of your firm at the company, location and arranger level.
