										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Funeral homes, crematories, and cemeteries are busy places filled with hazards for employees. Whether embalming, cremating, or digging, employees often find themselves with questions regarding workplace safety, and employers often find themselves thinking about downside risk. <a href="https://www.johnsonconsulting.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Johnson Consulting Group</a> has partnered with <a href="https://certifiedsafetytraining.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Certified Safety Training</a> to elevate compliance in the deathcare industry. What follows are ten steps to creating a comprehensive safety and compliance program.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>#1 Establish a Safety Supervisor</strong></h2>
<p>At a funeral home, crematory, or cemetery, the safety supervisor implements and enforces safety policies and procedures to prevent accidents, injuries, and health hazards in the work environment. Sometimes the employer or general manager holds this position, and other times regular employees hold this position.</p>
<h2><strong>#2 Set Clear Communication Channels</strong></h2>
<p>The safety supervisor works alongside management and employees to communicate safety procedures to employees, and ensure that these procedures are followed. It is also important to remember that even if the employer is not the safety supervisor, it is still the employer&#8217;s responsibility to adequately train the safety supervisor on their duties to be able to help all staff accomplish their work tasks safely.</p>
<h2><strong>#3</strong> <strong>Policy Development</strong></h2>
<p>Create and update safety protocols, guidelines, and procedures in accordance with industry standards and OSHA regulations. This includes safety training programs for employees. This should be done alongside the employer if the employer is not the safety supervisor.</p>
<h2><strong>#4 Risk Assessment</strong></h2>
<p>Conduct regular inspections and risk assessments of the workplace to identify potential hazards and risks. This involves analyzing processes, equipment, and conditions that might pose threats to employee safety. These should be communicated to the employer if the employer is not the safety supervisor.</p>
<h2><strong>#5 Safety Training</strong></h2>
<p>Organize and conduct safety training sessions for employees to educate them about safety protocols, emergency procedures, proper equipment handling, and the use of protective gear.</p>
<h2><strong>#6 Incident Investigation</strong></h2>
<p>Investigate accidents, near-misses, or safety-related incidents to determine their causes and prevent future occurrences. Then, analyze data and implement corrective actions to improve safety. Contact CST to learn about OSHA reporting exceptions in the deathcare industry.</p>
<h2><strong>#7 Localize Compliance</strong></h2>
<p>Ensure that the workplace complies with local, state, and federal safety regulations and standards. Twenty-nine (29) states have state-specific OSHA plans. Be sure to determine if you are in one of them and ensure your OSHA manual, training and recordkeeping meet your state requirements. Then keep abreast of changes in regulations and implement necessary adjustments.</p>
<h2><strong>#8 Emergency Preparedness</strong></h2>
<p>Develop emergency response plans and procedures for various scenarios like fires, chemical spills, or medical emergencies. Then, conduct drills annually to prepare employees for such situations.</p>
<h2><strong>#9 Collaboration</strong></h2>
<p>Work closely with management, HR, and other relevant departments to integrate safety practices into the organizational culture. OSHA training must be conducted “at the time of initial assignment” according to OSHA.</p>
<h2><strong>#10 Documentation and Reporting</strong></h2>
<p>Maintain detailed records of safety inspections, incidents, training sessions, and compliance activities. OSHA will not take your word for it. You must have written proof of all of your compliance and training activities or face citations.</p>

<p><strong>Scottsdale, AZ, [</strong><strong>Feb, 2020]</strong></p>
<p>Johnson Consulting Group and the Gary O’Sullivan Company announced a partnership to provide funeral home and cemeteries the needed expertise, methods, through their pre-need sales event.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The event is specifically for sales teams and their managers to learn how to effectively create a successful pre-need program within the Catholic ministry. The event will uncover a systematic sales process of effective selling: prospecting, appointment setting, effective pre-need presentations, protection security among families, as well as unique referrals. It will also focus on the sales manager role, covering their sales management plan, best leadership practices, motivating your team and getting the most out of your sales program.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“An effective and impactful pre-need sales program is not simply hiring someone, teaching them to fill out a contract, have them sit in your lobby, and write up the families that walk-in and asked to buy,” says Gary O’Sullivan, CCFE. “The goal of pre-need is to engage with the marketplace by talking to families who are the “undecided” and in the process helping them see the value of before need planning, getting them protected now, and in doing so, you are securing your future businesses today. Selling is a proactive, not reactive; it’s based on a proven process, not simply a pleasing personality, and build on the fundamental belief that the more you serve, the more you sell.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Both The Gary O’Sullivan Company and JCG believe that to accomplish this companies, need a proven selling method that is teachable, measurable, and executable. Director of Business Development, Lori Salberg says our core values and passion to serve others, this is without question, a perfect partnership.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“We are very excited to partner with Gary O’Sullivan on this event. He is an industry legend in pre-need sales and training,” says Lori Salberg. “He truly understands the unique ministerial aspect of Catholic cemetery pre-planning. Anyone working in pre-need sales (new, veteran, or in a managerial role), will benefit from time spent with Gary.”</p>
<p>“I have known and admired JCG throughout the years. They are a proven organization that focuses on aiding organizations to become and remain a healthy and viable business, using their innovating methodologies, which is something few consulting firms can do,” says O’Sullivan. “However, that is just part of why I respect JCG; it’s also because of the company’s character and focuses on not only processes but people as much or more. I view it as a privilege to work with the JCG on this event. It’s as exciting as it is humbling to partner on specific events with such a respected brand.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The event will take place on March 17th at the Diocese of Orange in Garden Grove, CA. For more information about event pricing and registration, please reach out to <a href="mailto:lsalberg@johnsonconsulting.com">lsalberg@johnsonconsulting.com</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Scottsdale, AZ [November 2019] – </strong>Johnson Consulting Group is excited to announce new features through Performance Tracker that will help cemetery businesses evaluate their numbers each month.</p>
<p>Performance Tracker will now send cemetery clients two automated monthly updates including a sales and survey summary. Cemetery businesses will be able to view and compare their monthly and Year to Date (YTD) statistics, including their total versus budgeted calls, as well as sales and sales averages through the sales summary report. They will also be able to view their average sales per case type by budgeted and actual amounts. The sales summary report will also detail YTD statistics of burial, cremation, calls, overall sales and averages. Businesses will be able to view their top arranges by name, sales average and number of cases.</p>
<p>Cemetery businesses will also be automatically alerted of their survey summary statistics. The survey summary details the YTD number of surveys received versus the number of surveys sent. Businesses will be notified upon receiving negative scores, perfect scores, personal stories or a new lead. Leads will be broken out into headstones and markers, bereavement, community events, prearranged funeral or cremation services, additional cemetery spaces and other variations.</p>
<p>Get your monthly tracking, as well as a YTD overview with Performance Tracker’s summaries!</p>
<p><em>“We are pleased to provide our cemetery clients with two monthly summary email reports. The survey summary highlights the prior month and YTD performance with key statistics about the customer’s experience. The contract analysis summary provides a recap of the prior month and YTD contract count by type (<strong>burial</strong>: graves, mausoleum, estates; <strong>cremation</strong>: graves, niches, scattering) including a stack ranking of the top arrangers’ performance. These summary reports provide an overview of the performance of the cemetery, and it is recommended that additional reports are reviewed in the Performance Tracker software to understand all the details. Please reach out to our Performance Tracker team as we are happy to assist with accessing and reviewing the robust reporting available.”</em></p>

<p>“The significant contributions made over time by the Memorial Classic have been game-changing,” said Lee Wiensch, Executive Director. The Memorial Classic donors have contributed more than $500,000 to the Funeral Service Foundation since the event began, allowing the Foundation to make meaningful grants and provide educational opportunities and scholarships that promote funeral service and ensure a bright future for our profession.”</p>

The Johnson family has always been passionate about Funeral Service Foundation’s mission which includes a strong approach to education that leads to promising careers in funeral service.</p>
<p>According to Tom Johnson, he began this golf tournament 38 years ago with the intent of just getting good friends in Funeral Service together for a few days of fellowship. The Classic now has roughly 130 participants each year who attend the event. “All of these gentlemen have been extremely generous in supporting the Memorial Classic mission. We are thankful to all attendees for their generosity”, stated Tom Johnson.</p>

<p>“You manage things and you lead people. Management is important, critical even. Budgets. Timelines. Equipment. Inventory. All need management. Humans, every organization’s most precious asset—by degrees of incalculable magnitude— don’t need or want to be managed. But they do in fact need and want to be led.” – Stephen R. Covey</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>We are inspired by our many clients that do incredible work in the communities they serve. One client that truly has inspired us over years of partnership is Solimine in Lynn, MA who does a lot of work with veterans, health related organizations, and local families in need.</div>
<div></div>
<div>We sat down for a Q&amp;A with owner and funeral director, Joel Solimine, to lean more about why Solimine is so passionate about the community they serve.</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h5><span style="color: #cc7022;"><strong>Q: Explain some of the ways you assist and have helped veterans.</strong></span></h5>
<p>All veterans are near and dear to our family, especially because two of Dave Sr.’s brothers, as well as his brother-in-law, were in the military. Dave Sr. was a member of the Army National Guard, but not a veteran. Any way that we can support veterans we can.</p>
<p>There have been countless events that we have spearheaded or supported to benefit veterans. We have sponsored the Traveling Vietnam wall to our city. In addition, we sponsored an all-expense paid bus trip for 100 local WWII Veterans from Lynn to Washington DC for the dedication of the WWII memorial in 2004. Solimine has also helped restore numerous war memorials and monuments with help from our friends the DeFillipo family from Woodlawn Memorials in Everett, MA. We have helped sponsor two military appreciation parades, one of which Dave Sr. was asked to be the grand marshal of the parade because of his tireless work with veterans. We hold a yearly Memorial Day Event at our local municipal Golf Club, a yearly Flag Retiring Ceremony at our city cemetery, and a yearly Veterans Day ceremony at our funeral home.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h5><span style="color: #cc7022;"><strong>Q: Which Solimine community event stands out to you and why? </strong></span></h5>
<p>The most fun event that we held was a just for fun month of ice cream socials celebrating our 50<sup>th</sup> anniversary 4 years ago. We held ice cream parties at over 20 different venues throughout the city from apartment complexes, police stations, fire stations, and everything in between. After securing our locations, we simply showed up and served as many ice cream Sundays as we could throughout the month of August. There was a great turn out at each location, and an unforgettable experience.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h5><span style="color: #cc7022;"><strong>Q: Can you tell us a little more about your passion for cancer research and awareness? </strong></span></h5>
<p>Both my grandfather, Dave Sr. and Mary Jane, my grandmother are cancer survivors,  so any organization benefiting cancer research or a family impacted by cancer is important to us. In the early 2000&#8217;s, Dave Jr. made a donation to the North Shore Medical Center. To this day, the emergency center is named Mary Jane and Dave Solimine Sr. Emergency Center. Dave Sr. is also a founding board member of the Boston North Cancer Association, where there is a scholarship in his name that is awarded to a high school senior who is a cancer survivor, or is currently undergoing treatment for cancer. In addition we sponsored the Boston Gay Men&#8217;s Chorus</p>
<p>Chorus to perform at our City Hall auditorium and all proceeds of the show were donated to the Lynn Community Health Center to help with the construction of their new building.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h5><span style="color: #cc7022;"><strong>Q: Talk to us about the community of Lynn, and how Solimine has contributed? </strong></span></h5>
<p>Something very near and dear to us are helping less fortunate families in our area. Lynn is a blue collar city with many families struggling financially, so anything we can do to help matters to us. Along with supporting the local soup kitchen and homeless shelters, we are involved in 2 main organizations, <em>Citizens Inn/</em> <em>Haven from Hunger</em>, and <em>Santa’s Island.</em></p>
<p>Citizens Inn / Haven from hunger is an organization that assists families transition out of homelessness. The Solimine Family is involved in real estate development, and have pledged $1,000 per house built in the Lynn / Peabody area to Citizens Inn. Over $100,000 has been donated to fight homelessness from the Solimine Family in the past 5 years.</p>
<p>Item Santa and Santa’s Island. Item Santa is a program with our local paper that assists struggling families with purchasing Christmas presents, who otherwise may not have any presents for their family. There is a traffic island in front of our Broadway location that has been dubbed as Santa’s Island because we collect funds for Item Santa, at least $20,000 every year for the past 15 years. Several years ago we noticed that there are still many families who do not make the cut, or miss out on the Item Santa program, so we started our own program through our nonprofit company, Solimine Charitable Corporation. Several other organizations and families assist, and teachers and social workers in the school system keep a lookout for children and families who are in need. We help purchase everything from boots and gloves in the winter, bathing suits and sneakers in the summer, clothing, groceries, toiletries; anything that family may need we will help purchase.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h5><span style="color: #cc7022;"><strong>Q: Where did all of these ideas for community outreach come from?</strong></span></h5>
<p>Community outreach has always been a passion of the Solimine Family. My grandfather Dave Sr. grew up in a modest home in Lynn where half of his siblings and parents were immigrants from Italy. He was determined to be successful, and at age 30 he started the funeral home, while being a wholesale florist and raising his 4 children with my grandmother. They always believed in giving back to the community in any way that they could, whether donating time and energy or money. My Dad Dave Jr. followed in his footsteps and raised my brother and I to become involved, and always support our community as they supported our family when Dave Sr. opened the funeral home.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We are honored to partner and serve our clients like Solimine, who go above and beyond for the communities they serve.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Scottsdale, AZ (June 6, 2019)</strong> &#8212; Johnson Consulting Group is excited to announce new and exciting features through Performance Tracker™ that will help funeral and cemetery businesses stay connected to the families they serve.</p>
<p>For nearly a decade, JCG Performance Tracker™ has been providing and reporting accurate measurements of customer satisfaction and sales performance through the power of surveys. With around 171,400 sales contracts and 123,000 surveys analyzed annually, JCG is able to benchmark industry standards for funeral and cemetery professionals to identify strengths and weaknesses, and establish actionable measures to improve their businesses.</p>
<p>The stay connected features include three key enhancements to our At-Need Surveys:</p>
<ul>
<li>Follow up sympathy cards</li>
<li>Mobile survey</li>
<li>Other Texting Capabilities</li>
</ul>
<p>The first of these features launching is the #StayConnected follow up cards. JCG Performance Tracker™ will now send a sympathy card right after services (paired with the traditional JCG Survey), along with a holiday card, and a remembrance card throughout the year. Businesses have the option to choose from four uniquely designed sets.  This add-on is now available for any Performance Tracker™ user at a <a href="https://go.johnsonconsulting.com/stayconnected/earlybird">discounted rate through the end of August!</a></p>

<p>The texting features and mobile survey are currently being tested at a beta location and are projected to be released by the end of Q2.</p>
