										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Historically, when funeral home owners contemplate the inevitability of increasing prices, one of the first steps in the process is to compare prices to the competition. Although it is well worth considering there is no more important comparison than is your forecasted Revenue meets or exceeds and Operational Expense. Knowing what it <u>takes</u> to provide a service at your funeral homes is critical to determining what you need to <u>make </u>from that service. The minimum operational expense involved in providing a service, we refer to as Recovery Cost.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>Calculating Recovery Cost, and How to Effectively Update Your Prices</strong></h2>
<p>In the simplest of terms, Recovery cost represents the cost of operation related to specific funeral services. Imagine if every family was required to pay an equal share of the business’ operational costs.</p>
<p>Hypothetical:</p>
<p>Funeral home provides burial and cremation services (200 annually) at an average cost of $5,000 generating $1,000,000 in revenue.</p>
<p>The annual operational expense is $700,000 rendering a 30% Profit (JCG client target profitability).</p>
<p>The Recovery Cost for the funeral home is $3,500 ($700,000 / 200 cases = $3,500).</p>
<p>The funeral home has a 50% case mix charging $8,500 for burial and $1,500 for cremation.</p>
<p>Note, the cremation sales average of $1,500 is ($2,000) short of the firm’s recovery cost. However, the burial sales average of $8,500 exceeds the recovery cost by $7,000 and easily subsidizes the cremation sales.</p>
<p>However, the funeral home is experiencing a gradual case mix shift decreasing burial and increasing cremation by 5% respectively. This shift in case mix would result in a drop in profitability from 30% to 27.5%.  If this trend continues to a 40% burial and 60% cremation mix, profitability will drop to 18.6% (an 11.4% drop in profitability).</p>
<p>In the past, funeral homes had the luxury of generating more revenue from burial services, which helped subsidize the artificially lowered charges for direct cremations to remain comparable to a competitor who may have substantially lower costs of operation. However, with cremation rates reaching 70-80% in some markets, the landscape has changed. Funeral homes now find themselves in a precarious position, struggling to subsidize cremations as the case mix shifts and facing a continuous drop in overall revenue. Couple this with increasing Labor Costs and Cost of Goods Sold, and the challenge intensifies.</p>
<p>The previous hypothetical is a simplified scenario to help illustrate a trend. The cost of conducting a traditional burial is substantially different from that of a direct cremation and should reflect that in the pricing. However, as cremation mix continues to increase it will be necessary for it to bear the recovery cost of <strong><u>your</u></strong> funeral home without regard to your competition.</p>
<p>To address this, funeral home owners must examine their recovery cost for the services they provide. Considering factors such as full-time equivalency (FTE), the significant increases in Cost of Goods Sold, the increase cost of labor for new employees and the potential cost of adjusting the salaries of veteran employees, inflation, etc.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>The Fear of Losing Call Volume: A Common Concern</strong></h2>
<p>A common concern that looms over funeral home owners contemplating a price adjustment is the fear of losing call volume due to higher prices driving families away. Although, the thought of losing a family is antithetical to our caregiver mentality, it&#8217;s essential to recognize that this fear can be misleading. If you&#8217;re providing services at a loss or barely breaking even, the long-term results may jeopardize your overall ability to serve families at all and will definitely impact the firm’s enterprise value and your personal succession plan.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>Real-World Examples</strong></h2>
<p>In working with funeral and cemetery operations across the country, we consistently observe firms increasing their burial costs by 3+% (5-8% in recent years). By contrast, cremation prices were held constant due to competition. This results in a common question we are asked, “I’m busier than ever and making less money – Why is that?”</p>
<p>By holding the line on cremation prices, their revenue sources shifted, and they found themselves not generating income in line with the way their expenses had increased.</p>
<p>This example serves as a powerful reminder of the critical role recovery cost plays in maintaining the financial health of a funeral home. It prompts us to question the conventional wisdom of merely meeting competition prices and encourages a shift towards charging based on the actual cost of running a unique funeral home operation.</p>
<p>Understanding your recovery cost is a crucial first step for funeral home owners looking to set meaningful prices for their services and merchandise. It&#8217;s time to move away from the traditional mindset of merely meeting competition prices. Instead, charge based on what it takes to run your funeral home efficiently, factoring in the unique aspects that set your business and the services you provide apart from the competition.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>As Benjamin Franklin once said, “In this world, nothing is certain but death and taxes,” so if you’re looking to enter a profession, funeral homes (or accounting) might seem like a lucrative choice. </p>

]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Navigating business continuity in the death care profession demands strategic foresight, especially when confronted with unexpected challenges. There’s much to consider while owning and operating a funeral home: </span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">When to retire.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Who is next in line for funeral home management?</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you want to continue being involved.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">When is the right time to sell?</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Who is the right person to take on the legacy?</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Is my current succession plan up-to-date?</span></li>
<li><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">What happens if I, or a key figure, unexpectedly pass</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">?  </span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We deeply understand the profound impact the untimely loss of any key figure can have on family-owned business. The question becomes even more critical: How can funeral home and cemetery owners thrive after the unplanned departure of a key figure? In smaller establishments, where the principal operator often wears multiple hats, from daily operations to public representation, the challenges magnify. The public&#8217;s confidence in the business&#8217;s continuity may waver following the loss of a prominent figure. At Johnson Consulting Group, drawing from over 600 years of industry expertise, we comprehend the intricacies involved in such transitions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Complicating matters are the well-intentioned yet diverse pieces of advice survivors receive. The dynamics shift dramatically, especially when partners find themselves in business with the deceased&#8217;s spouse, who may lack practical experience. We&#8217;ve witnessed firsthand the potential pitfalls and family conflicts that can arise in these situations. This is why <a href="https://www.johnsonconsulting.com/how-to-protect-your-legacy-when-succession-planning/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">funeral home succession planning</a> is paramount. We&#8217;ve assisted numerous families in navigating this process, emphasizing the importance of evaluating which aspects of the business survivors can effectively operate. Quality often surpasses quantity, as a smaller, well-managed business stands the test of time, while larger, weaker enterprises may face financial challenges.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Looking beyond the immediate challenges, it becomes imperative to consider the next generation of funeral home owners and funeral directors. Ensuring a seamless transition to capable hands is not only a strategic business move but also a commitment to upholding the traditions and values that define your establishment. Cultivating the skills and passion of the next generation is an investment in the longevity of your funeral home management and business in general.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This leads us to a pivotal point often under-prioritized in strategic planning and the lead-up to the sale of a funeral home business – recognizing the crucial role that next-generation leadership development plays in succession planning, business growth, and enterprise value. Without an intentional plan of action, the skillsets of next-generation owners or leaders will not develop or improve on their own. Acknowledging that being a good funeral director does not necessarily equate to being a good manager or business owner, we advocate for the creation of a comprehensive plan that provides ample opportunities for skill development.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Consider looking beyond the confines of your organization for opportunities such as <a href="https://www.johnsonconsulting.com/services/business-consulting/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">management coaching</a> or participation in distinguished <a href="https://lp.constantcontactpages.com/su/CKDNABr/LMSpring24" target="_blank" rel="noopener">leadership and management</a> development programs. By investing in the professional growth of your next-generation leaders, you not only enhance the long-term success of your business but also elevate your funeral home management and the overall value of your enterprise. At Johnson Consulting Group, we deeply understand the intricate interplay between succession planning, business growth, and leadership development. We stand ready to guide you through these critical aspects, ensuring a prosperous and sustainable future for your funeral home.</span></p>
