It\u2019s important, however, to fully vet the funeral homes that you&#8217;re curious about.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">By thoroughly examining the businesses that you hope to purchase\u2013and knowing which factors to examine\u2013you can better ensure your future success. Here are some red flags to watch out for when looking at funeral homes for sale.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">High Employee Turnover<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The total number of people who have left a company, both voluntarily and involuntarily, is employee turnover and an important way to measure the health of any business. For funeral businesses, which tend to operate with smaller teams, high turnover rates can be a sign of deeper issues.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">High turnover rates generally indicate a lack of employee purpose, poor compensation, bad management, or an overall toxic work environment, and when you take over a funeral home, it\u2019s unlikely that these problems will vanish on their own, meaning you\u2019ll have to invest time and money into hiring new team members.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ideally, when you take the helms of a funeral home, its employees will transition seamlessly into your team. However, high employee turnover is the first sign that there are complicated issues affecting the business, issues that might make it difficult to operate effectively.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Unorganized Financials<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Before purchasing a funeral home, you\u2019ll want to see an accurate and detailed financial picture over the last few years. Not only will this help you determine the business\u2019s value, but it will also let you know what you stand to gain in profits.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In most cases, you should ask to see:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Profit and loss statements for the current and past three years<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Current balance sheets<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cash flow statements<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Tax returns for the past three years<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Audited financial statements<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lists of any business debts<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If the current owner of a business is unable to quickly provide you with these documents, this is a huge red flag. At the very least, disorganized financials imply a lack of reliable information. At worst, they could indicate a business owner is trying to gloss over a less than ideal financial picture, hoping to pass it on to you.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Low Preneed Backlog<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.johnsonconsulting.com\/increase-your-preneed-sales-with-these-7-tips\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Preneed sales<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, that is, pre-arranged funeral-related services, are one of the strongest indicators of a <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.johnsonconsulting.com\/make-your-funeral-business-more-profitable\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">thriving funeral business<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. If a funeral home has an extensive backlog of preneed arrangements, then this indicates that they\u2019ve secured future business and likely have a degree of loyalty within the greater community.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If a funeral business has an underwhelming preneed backlog, then there is no way to guarantee its future. On a deeper level, it can even imply an underperforming sales team, something you\u2019ll have to take time and money to fix.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A Vastly Changing Market\u00a0<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Since 2009, the total <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/nfda.org\/news\/statistics\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">number of funeral homes in the U.S.<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> has fallen steadily each year, indicating higher competition among the businesses that survive. What\u2019s more, new trends are emerging in death care, such as a growing preference for cremation and alternative celebrations of life. Funeral homes are not immune to shifting trends and competition.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When looking to purchase a funeral home, you should take care to examine the market in the region. You\u2019ll want to consider:<\/span><b><\/b><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li aria-level=\"1\"><b>Competition: <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How many other funeral businesses are in the region, and what sizes are they? What advantages are held by the business you hope to purchase? Which funeral business is the dominant player?<\/span><\/li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\"><b>Population: <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How many people are in the region? Is the population growing or shrinking? Does the population skew older or younger? What are the dominant religions in the area, particularly as they relate to death care? Do locals prefer certain types of memorial arrangements?<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While employees, facilities, and services can all be fine-tuned, location is the one thing that you can\u2019t change about a business. This is why it\u2019s important to examine it closely and analyze your future prospects in this locale.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How to Vet Funeral Home Businesses\u00a0<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To vet a funeral business, you\u2019ll want to look at each of its aspects at a high level to see if there are any red flags that indicate you should back off. Think of it as buying a house. While there are certainly people who wish to purchase a flawed home and conduct extensive renovations, this looks very different for a business and could mean its failure is inevitable.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To vet a funeral home, you can go it alone, but your best option is to seek the help of experts who specialize in the death care industry.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.johnsonconsulting.com\/services\/become-a-jcg-buyer\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Johnson Consulting Group<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, their team of brokers and consultants can help you identify which funeral businesses align with your needs, coordinate with sellers, and even conduct a full financial analysis of a prospective funeral business.
