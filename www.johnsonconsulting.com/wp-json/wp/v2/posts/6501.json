According to the Cremation Association of North America, the <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.cremationassociation.org\/page\/IndustryStatistics\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">2020 cremation rate<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> was 54.6%, and in 2022 this number is expected to climb.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That said, in addition to the rising rates of cremation, we can also expect some other trends relating to cost, availability, and preference for memorial services. Here\u2019s what\u2019s on the horizon in 2022.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Cost Will Increase<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although the continuing waves of COVID-19 have undoubtedly contributed to the rising rates of cremation, waning health risks likely won\u2019t hinder the popularity of cremation. With many American families struggling financially, cremations present an affordable alternative to traditional funeral arrangements. The <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/nfda.org\/news\/statistics\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">average cost of a burial and funeral<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is about $8,000, while direct cremations can cost as low as $1,000.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In 2022, however, the cost of cremation is likely to rise across the board. Part of this can be attributed to supply and demand. More people want cremations, so the prices will spike accordingly. Additionally, increased gas prices, higher fees for cremation permits, and supply chain issues related to equipment.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Competition Will Be Steep<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As the majority of families utilize cremations, many funeral homes are offering those services. In some cases, you can expect to see price wars. So while the overall cost of cremation will likely rise, certain areas might experience increased competition, thus driving down the prices temporarily.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For example, if a larger funeral company acquires several small businesses with strong cremation portfolios\u2013\u2013as is currently happening\u2013\u2013they could afford to artificially deflate prices with the hope of running competitors out of business. If they succeed in doing so, prices will likely rise in the aftermath.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Supply Chain Issues Will Affect Expansions<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To address the growing popularity of cremations, many funeral homes are expanding their services by building or purchasing crematoriums of their own; however, the current supply chain crisis is delaying this process.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In addition to the actual equipment needed for cremation processes, funeral directors are also experiencing a <\/span><a href=\"http:\/\/www.nomispublications.com\/Newspaper\/12-2021\/50\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">scarcity of construction materials<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, severely hindering timelines and budgets. Additionally, with nationwide labor shortages, those attempting to expand into the cremation business are facing higher costs for architects and contractors.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There Will Be a Rising Shift Toward Green Burials<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While the rise in overall rates of cremation dominates the conversation, another interesting trend is a growing interest in alternative arrangements. In 2021, the NFDA reported that 72% of families had an interest in green funeral options due to the cost savings, environmental impact, or embracing of new traditions.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Human composting and aquamation\u2013\u2013both of which have only captured small niches of interest\u2013\u2013are expected to grow in both availability and popularity. While not as widely available as traditional cremation, these services offer lower price tags and lessened carbon footprints.\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Prepare for What\u2019s Coming\u00a0<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Between the risks of in-person gatherings, the increased economic precarity, and a continued rise in secularism, Americans are causing a dramatic shift in the way we practice death care. Cremations have eclipsed burials as the most popular option, and this trend shows no signs of slowing down, not to mention the emergence of alternative funeral technologies.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With competition rising, it\u2019s important to stay ahead of the curve. Many funeral homes that were slow to incorporate cremation into their services are now stuck waiting to expand. Meanwhile, proactive businesses are reaping the rewards of quickly adapting to changing trends. To help make sure your funeral business is prepared for the future, you might consider seeking the help of professionals.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.johnsonconsulting.com\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Johnson Consulting Group<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, their team of business professionals is highly skilled in all things related to the death care profession.
