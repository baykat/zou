That said, an impending sale requires careful attention and planning. Failing to consider all the components of a successful sale can cause you to take an unfavorable deal.\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To help you learn from the mistakes of others, here are the most common ways owners lose money in a sale.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">1. Taxes<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Selling a funeral business requires careful <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.johnsonconsulting.com\/funeral-home-tax-strategies\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">consideration of tax implications<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. First and foremost, you\u2019ll want to consider the capital gains tax. Since funeral homes are typically owned for many years, they often see a significant increase in value from the time of the initial purchase.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In 2023, the capital gains tax rate was between 15%-20% for most individuals. So if you purchased a funeral business for $100,000 and sold it for $800,000, you could owe between $105,000 and $140,000 in capital gains taxes.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Additionally, since most funeral businesses include real estate, you\u2019ll also want to consider the depreciation recapture tax. If you\u2019ve been deducting a percentage of your facilities\u2019 values from regular wear and tear, then the IRS will collect taxes on the eventual profitable sale of said facilities. <\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">2. Under or Overestimating Your Funeral Home\u2019s Value<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You wouldn\u2019t sell a house without first getting it appraised. In a similar way, you can\u2019t sell your funeral home without obtaining a formal valuation. One of the biggest mistakes when selling funeral homes is failing to know the actual value of the business beforehand.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Underestimating the value of your funeral home can lead to the loss of hundreds of thousands of dollars. On the other hand, overestimating its value will likely prevent a sale altogether, even though offers may have been correct values for the business. This puts the seller in a position of holding onto the business longer than they should.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Obtaining a valuation will also let you know if you\u2019re ready to sell. This is why a <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.johnsonconsulting.com\/5-reasons-why-you-should-get-a-business-valuation-every-year\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">valuation should be conducted once per year<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. If your funeral home is valued lower than you\u2019d anticipated, you might need to hold off on selling until you can improve and obtain a higher valuation.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">3. Following Insanity<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting a different result, that holds true with how we operate funeral homes, but wanting a higher value.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When people want a higher value, there&#8217;s nothing wrong with that. What&#8217;s wrong is they don&#8217;t do anything about it. When you find that you have a certain expectation for retirement, the next step is to hire an outside consultant to come in, review your financials, how you operate your business, and create a strategic plan to get you to the value you&#8217;re looking for.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Most people do not follow this step and just expect that somehow their value will be more in the future, which is not a good plan and typically follows the definition of insanity. Don&#8217;t expect osmosis to create a higher value for your business, create a strategic plan, and take control of your future destiny.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">4. Taking the DIY Method<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Some funeral home owners attempt to <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.johnsonconsulting.com\/selling-alone-vs-funeral-home-broker\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">sell their businesses on their own<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Unfortunately, this method is not only likely to fail, but \u2013\u2013 in the event that you succeed \u2013\u2013 you\u2019ll lose out on additional dollars.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While an accountant or lawyer can likely help with the process, only an industry expert understands the specifics of funeral home transactions \u2013\u2013 including structure, ownership benefits after the transaction, tax strategies, confidentiality, when site visits are appropriate, when staff notifications are appropriate, and the list goes on! <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">An expert in the industry will already know these ins and outs and can get the most value out of your sale.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Why a Funeral Home Broker Is a MUST<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">From seeking out qualified buyers to negotiating a favorable deal, a funeral home broker plays an essential role in the sale of a death care business.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At Johnson Consulting Group, our team will ensure that you do not lose money on your sale.

This tax will be the same as your income tax, which you\u2019ll also want to consider.\u00a0\u00a0<\/span>\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">2. Underestimating Your Funeral Home\u2019s Value<\/span><\/h2>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You wouldn\u2019t sell a house without first getting it appraised. In a similar way, you can\u2019t sell your funeral home without obtaining a formal valuation. One of the biggest time wasters when selling funeral homes is failing to know the actual value of the business.\u00a0<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Underestimating the value of your funeral home can lead to the loss of hundreds of thousands of dollars. On the other hand, overestimating its value will likely prevent a sale altogether, as no qualified buyer would purchase a funeral home without seeing a valuation from an independent broker or accountant.\u00a0<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Obtaining a valuation will also let you know if you\u2019re ready to sell. This is why a <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.johnsonconsulting.com\/5-reasons-why-you-should-get-a-business-valuation-every-year\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">valuation should be conducted at least once per year<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. If your funeral home is valued lower than you\u2019d anticipated, you might need to hold off on selling until you can improve and obtain a higher valuation.<\/span>\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">3. Not Considering the Market<\/span><\/h2>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Naturally, you\u2019ll want to sell your business when it\u2019s at peak value. Beyond making internal changes that boost this value, you\u2019ll also have to consider the greater market conditions. Similar to real estate, the market for funeral business is subject to peaks and valleys.\u00a0<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For example, during the pandemic, many funeral homes were hit hard by the inability of people to gather safely in person. As a result, the market for buying funeral homes slowed and this type of business was worth less than normal. So while savvy buyers could purchase a funeral business for a bargain, sellers got the short end of the stick during this time.\u00a0<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You\u2019ll also want to consider the type of buyer you might appeal to. This will vary based on the size of your business, its location, and its profitability. Large corporations will rarely buy a funeral home with less than 250 yearly calls. In terms of location, you\u2019ll also want to think about the population. If your business exists in a growing area, then this will point to favorable market conditions, as a higher population indicates the potential for more business.<\/span>\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">4. Taking the DIY Method<\/span><\/h2>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To save money, many funeral home owners attempt to <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.johnsonconsulting.com\/selling-alone-vs-funeral-home-broker\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">sell their businesses on their own<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.

An expert in the industry will already know these ins and outs and can get the most value out of your sale.<\/span>\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Why a Funeral Home Broker Is a MUST<\/span><\/h3>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">From seeking out qualified buyers to negotiating a favorable deal, a funeral home broker plays an essential role in the sale of a death care business. While they do charge a commission, funeral home brokers are the best way to secure a fair sale in minimal time.\u00a0<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At Johnson Consulting Group, our brokers can help connect you with an expansive network of qualified buyers. Additionally, our accounting team can conduct a reliable valuation of your business. If the valuation comes back less than desired, our team can help guide you through the improvements you need to warrant an agreeable price tag.\u00a0<\/span>\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n[button link=\"https:\/\/www.johnsonconsulting.com\/contact-us\/\"] GET IN CONTACT[\/button]\r\n\r\n\u00a0","_et_gb_content_width":"","inline_featured_image":false,"footnotes":""},"categories":[4,42],"tags":[69,61],"class_list":["post-7158","post","type-post","status-publish","format-standard","has-post-thumbnail","hentry","category-blog","category-sell-my-business","tag-funeral-homes","tag-sell-my-business"],"acf":[],"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO Premium plugin v21.0 (Yoast SEO v24.3) - https:\/\/yoast.com\/wordpress\/plugins\/seo\/ -->\n<title>Funeral Businesses for Sale: Top 4 Ways Owners Lose Money - Johnson Consulting Group<\/title>\n<meta name=\"description\" content=\"Considering selling your funeral business?
