In addition to considering the legal and financial concerns that come with brokering a business of any sort, you\u2019ll also have to pay attention to the funeral home itself\u2013how it\u2019s currently performing, employees, current management, etc.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Learning how to buy a funeral home can be easier with the right resources. To make sure you cover each one as thoroughly as possible, you\u2019ll want to consider teaming up with professionals.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Step 1: Partner with a Broker<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">No matter how experienced you are with the death care industry, buying (or selling) a funeral home is most streamlined when you partner with a broker. And while there are firms that offer generic business brokerage services, your best bet is to find a group that specializes in funeral and cemetery businesses.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For example, <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.johnsonconsulting.com\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Johnson Consulting Group<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, the nation\u2019s largest funeral broker, maintains an extensive network of funeral professionals. This allows them to figure out which business is the best match for your goals as a funeral director. Moreover, they understand the current market conditions and how you can best work with them in the future.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Step 2: Find Your Future Funeral Home\u00a0<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When looking to purchase a funeral home, it\u2019s tempting to turn to public listings (similar to real estate); however, purchasing a business is deeper than matters of land, facilities, and equipment. You\u2019ll also want to account for the state of a business\u2013its earnings, reputation, employees, and overall positioning in the marketplace.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As a buyer, you should pay close attention to the following <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.johnsonconsulting.com\/funeral-homes-for-sale-red-flags-to-watch-out-for\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">red flags<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, as they can indicate a business with problems that will carry over to a new owner:<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">High Employee Turnover<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With any business, employee turnover is a good indication of its health. If people are constantly leaving to work elsewhere, then this indicates they\u2019re unhappy working there, something that will become your problem if you were to take over.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Low Preneed Backlog<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One of the surest ways to determine the future success of a funeral business is through its sale of <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.johnsonconsulting.com\/increase-your-preneed-sales-with-these-7-tips\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">pre-arranged funeral-related services<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. While a lengthy pre-need backlog speaks to the continued patronage of families, a lacking (or nonexistent) backlog might indicate the funeral home is struggling or employees aren\u2019t selling.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Poor Market Positioning<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If a funeral home is in an area with a shrinking population, then the outlook for its future might not be ideal. Additionally, you\u2019ll want to consider the number of local competitors and how they stand in relation to the existing funeral business.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Disorganized Financials<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When purchasing a funeral business, you\u2019ll want to see a detailed breakdown of its profits, losses, and tax returns, among other concerns. If a current owner is unable to provide you with these documents, you\u2019ll have no way of safeguarding yourself from investing in a money pit. <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.johnsonconsulting.com\/tax-return-accuracy-importance\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Disorganized financial information<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> can also create a nightmare in terms of taxes.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Step 3: Review the Finances<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When looking to <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.johnsonconsulting.com\/diving-into-the-requirements-to-open-a-funeral-home\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">purchase a funeral home<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, you\u2019ll want a clear picture of a business\u2019s financial health. During initial discussions, you\u2019ll want to see the following:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Three years of profit and loss statements<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Updated balance sheets<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cash flow statements<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Three years of tax returns<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Audited financial statements<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lists of any business debts and assets<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There is no hard rule for what makes a business a worthwhile investment, as failing funeral homes can be turned around by skilled directors. What you want is as much information as possible about a funeral home so that you can make an educated decision about whether or not it\u2019s worth your purchase.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Additionally, these financial documents will prove essential to determining a fair valuation. Once complete, you\u2019ll have a sure idea of whether a business is worth the seller\u2019s asking price.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Step 4: Provide Your Information<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the same way that you examine a potential business purchase, the current owner will also want to ensure that you\u2019re a qualified buyer. First and foremost, they\u2019ll need to know that you have access to the capital required to purchase their business. All of the funeral experience can\u2019t make up for lack of funds.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A seller will also want to see that you have a history of business ownership, ideally as a death care professional. This assures them that you aren\u2019t a dilettante and that you are capable of the demands of a funeral director.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To address these concerns, you\u2019ll want to come to the discussion table with documentation of your credentials. If you currently run a funeral business, provide proof of this through your business and mortician licenses and certifications. To demonstrate your financial ability to purchase the funeral home, you could show notarized bank statements and pre-approval for SBA or other loans.\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Step 5: Get in the Weeds<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you\u2019ve made it this far in the process, you\u2019ll want to begin to dig deep into a funeral business and figure out the finer points that won\u2019t be expressed through financial documents. For starters, this will likely mean signing a letter of intent (LOI). This document will serve as a preliminary commitment on your part to do business with them. It also will include an NDA, allowing you to more closely look at the current operations of a funeral business.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Once you&#8217;re given access to a business\u2019s inner workings, you\u2019ll want to pay close attention to its employees. These are the people who will potentially work for you, so you\u2019ll want to ask yourself if their skill sets and attitudes could work well under your leadership.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Additionally, you should look at a business\u2019s marketing efforts which demonstrate how they interface with community members. Even the most skilled funeral professionals will have trouble saving a funeral business with a poor local reputation.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Step 6: Negotiate the Purchase<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When negotiating the purchase, you\u2019ll take into account every aspect of the business, from its land and property to its functioning as a living and breathing entity. All of these factors will come together in a valuation of a funeral business.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This is where a skilled funeral broker can be an essential source of knowledge. Not only will they understand the brokerage process, but they\u2019ll also know the finer points of funeral home businesses, and they\u2019ll be able to valuate the business fairly. Once they\u2019ve determined the value of the business, you\u2019ll be ready to put in your initial offer and begin negotiating.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Step 7: Due Diligence and Closing<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Once you\u2019ve completed your due diligence and readied your offer, the time will come to formalize the purchase agreement. This formal agreement will delineate the price and the terms of the purchase, ensuring a smooth transition from the former owner to your command. It\u2019s essential to make sure the terms of this agreement are to your liking, and these negotiations often take several rounds to satisfy both parties.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Upon closing, all aspects of the business transaction will conclude. The title, deed, and other relevant documents are executed and exchanged, and the funds are transferred. Most often, the closing occurs at an attorney\u2019s office.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Making the Transition Smooth<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To help make the transition as smooth as possible, you\u2019ll want to consider employing the help of experienced funeral brokers. For example, the brokerage team at Johnson Consulting Group will work with legal professionals to make sure all legal requirements are upheld.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">By partnering with the JCG team from the beginning, you\u2019ll ensure a seamless process of finding, evaluating, and acquiring a new funeral business. With their experienced financial analysts and funeral business consultants, they\u2019ll not only pair you with ideal sellers, but they\u2019ll help you through every stage of the process.<\/span><\/p>\n<a href='https:\/\/www.johnsonconsulting.com\/contact-us\/' class='small-button smallblue'>TAKE THE RIGHT STEPS<\/a>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Learning how to buy a funeral home isn\u2019t difficult with the right resources.
