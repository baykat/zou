Beyond upgrading their facilities and offering innovative memorial services, funeral homes must also consider the way in which they attract new business, that is, their marketing strategy.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Gone are the days of guaranteed loyalty from families in the community. With competition increasing throughout the country, you can no longer rely on the passive acquisition of clients. Instead, funeral homes must take an active approach to raise awareness of their services and compelling families to book.\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here are some frequently heard myths about funeral home marketing and how you can implement more effective approaches.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">1. Word of Mouth Is Enough<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When a person talks about a funeral home\u2019s services to their friends, family, and acquaintances, this is what\u2019s known as word of mouth marketing. And while this type of free advertising is <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/review42.com\/resources\/word-of-mouth-marketing-statistics\/#:~:text=WOMM%20brings%20in%205%20times,most%20effective%20form%20of%20marketing.\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">incredibly effective<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u2013\u2013after all, people tend to trust their friends over media outlets\u2013\u2013word of mouth is unpredictable.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Rather than wait for clients to organically rave about your funeral home, you should encourage them to do so. When thanking families for booking a service, politely ask them to share their experience on social media and tag your funeral home\u2019s pages.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In addition to asking families to talk about your business online, you should also ask them to complete a survey discussing their experience. Surveying families is one of the most effective ways to understand how your funeral home currently meets their needs and learn how you can do better.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">2. Reviews Manage Themselves<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In many cases when a person runs a Google search for your funeral home, reviews from former families will be among the first things they see, making it important that they leave a good impression.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One study finds that <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.qualtrics.com\/blog\/online-review-stats\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">93% of people read online reviews<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> before buying a product or service. With this in mind, you\u2019ll want to make sure that your portfolio of online reviews accomplishes two goals.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<ol>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Accrue as many positive reviews as possible.<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Both the quantity and quality of these reviews will also <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.searchenginepeople.com\/blog\/just-how-much-do-google-reviews-impact-your-seo-ranking.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">help your SEO<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, making your funeral home appear near the top of Google searches.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Respond to negative reviews.<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> If a person is researching your <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.johnsonconsulting.com\/difference-between-happy-and-satisfied-funeral-families\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">funeral home\u2019s reputation<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, their eye will undoubtedly be drawn to negative reviews. Because of this, you want to take time to mitigate their impact by responding to dissatisfied families in a thoughtful, apologetic tone. Remember, they are likely working with you during some of the most emotional moments of their life.<\/span><\/span>&nbsp;<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">3. A Website Is Unnecessary<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With social media pages and listings in online business directories, you might think that a standalone website is superfluous; however, a funeral home website is an essential component of your branding and outreach.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One study finds that a business\u2019s <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/blog.hubspot.com\/blog\/tabid\/6307\/bid\/5501\/Research-Shows-Websites-Influence-97-of-Clients-Purchasing-Decisions.aspx\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">website influences 97%<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> of clients\u2019 purchasing decisions. Think of your website as a digital first impression. When a person searches for your funeral home online, they\u2019ll likely look to your website for authoritative information related to hours, phone numbers, services, and professionalism.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">4. At Need Is the Most Important Audience<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.johnsonconsulting.com\/preneed-funeral-sales\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Increasing your preneed sales<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is one of the most effective ways to increase the value of your funeral home as well as ensure business in the future. To build a preneed sales program, you\u2019ll want to address several family touchpoints: online, in-person, and through partnerships.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Many people are unaware that they can book a funeral service ahead of time, so your first step will be education. By letting people know that options are available ahead of time\u2013\u2013and training your sales team in preneed practices\u2013\u2013you can increase the likelihood of people booking these services and flesh out your preneed backlog.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Continue Growing<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Unless you have a proactive approach to reaching your current and prospective families, you\u2019ll undoubtedly fall behind the competition. To ensure the best returns on your marketing efforts, it\u2019s often helpful to <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.johnsonconsulting.com\/6-things-to-look-for-in-a-funeral-business-consultant\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">call in consultants<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At Johnson Consulting Group, our team of funeral home consultants has helped funeral homes in all stages and sizes develop marketing strategies that deliver consistent results.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Armed with a knowledge of both funeral-specific outreach practices and marketplace trends, they can help your team build a strategy that enshrines continued business while bringing new families into the fold.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<a href='https:\/\/www.johnsonconsulting.com\/contact-us\/' class='small-button smallblue'>GROW YOUR FUNERAL HOME<\/a>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>As the funeral profession evolves, so must your efforts to meet the needs of families.
