By creating a positive workplace culture, one that enables employees to flourish, you can ensure that your families will receive the best experience possible.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Create a Healthy, Supportive Work Culture<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Your leadership sets the tone for how the entire workplace operates. For starters, your leadership team should lead by example. If you want a workplace in which team members regularly give and receive feedback, then your leaders should do so themselves. If team members are expected to be punctual or occasionally work overtime, then leadership should do the same.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Leadership also creates a positive work culture through various acts of engagement. This could include mapping out career paths with each of your team members, <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.johnsonconsulting.com\/4-components-incentive-compensation-plan\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">developing an incentive compensation plan<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, and consistently communicating the \u201cwhy\u201d regarding how much service and quality means to grieving families. By engaging your employees in these ways, you can ensure that they\u2019ll be driven to give families better customer service.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Set Clear Expectations<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As with any type of organization, the leadership of a funeral home must create and enforce workplace expectations. Formally establishing and recognizing these standards allows team members to have a clear sense of direction and provide families with a more consistent experience. You can communicate these expectations during regular 1:1 meetings and employee reviews.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">These expectations and standards can be related to workplace behavior, performance, tasks, and outcomes. In most cases, you can display expectations in an employee handbook and job descriptions. When providing feedback to team members, leadership should also refer to these standards, allowing employees to see how they\u2019re living up to expectations.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That said, you shouldn\u2019t make the rules so strict that there\u2019s no room for your team members to adapt. Families have different needs, and your rules should provide the flexibility needed to meet these different sets of needs. When implemented properly, formal expectations will empower your employees, giving them the power to make certain decisions on their own without a manager\u2019s approval.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For example, you might consider giving team members the power to offer up to $200 in incentives without manager approval, giving them extra negotiating power while working with families.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Invest in Employee Growth<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One of the surest ways to optimize family experience is to <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.johnsonconsulting.com\/everything-you-need-to-know-about-jcgs-workshop-and-training-options\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">invest in employee growth<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.

Additionally, team members would benefit from staying up to date on industry trends, allowing them to answer questions and recommend products and services with confidence.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ideally, within the early days of a team member\u2019s employment, leadership will sit down with them and create a long-term plan for career growth. This might include training that allows them to take on additional responsibilities, as well as mentorship opportunities.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If employees don\u2019t feel like they\u2019re growing with your business, then they\u2019ll likely seek work elsewhere.
