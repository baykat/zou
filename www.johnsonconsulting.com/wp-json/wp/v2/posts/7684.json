There are legal factors, unknown tax implications due to sale structure, negotiations, marketing, working through due diligence (inspections, compilation of business documents and financial information, etc.) managing the transaction to closing once an offer is signed, and a lot of organization that is required to cross the finish line. Enlisting and entrusting an experienced third-party to help guide and navigate your team\u00a0 through the transaction journey, is the best way to ensure you\u2019re getting the best price and will experience a smooth transition from current Owner to new Owner.
