While the former trend might have proven a temporary solution, the popularity of cremation shows few signs of slowing down, making it essential for funeral directors and owners to incorporate cremation services into their business model.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Additionally, while the majority of Americans still identify as Christian\u2013\u2013and are thus likely to align with traditional burial practices\u2013\u2013the number of secular Americans <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.washingtonpost.com\/religion\/2021\/12\/17\/secular-pew-poll\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">continues to grow<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While it\u2019s impossible to make a blanket statement about this group\u2019s preferences for death care practices, one can assume that we\u2019ll see resulting upticks in the popularity of alternative burial methods like human composting and aquamation.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To Engage Employees<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you want to <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.johnsonconsulting.com\/5-ways-to-keep-quality-talent-in-your-funeral-home\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">keep quality talent at your funeral home<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, the statistics show that you\u2019ll need to provide continued learning opportunities.
