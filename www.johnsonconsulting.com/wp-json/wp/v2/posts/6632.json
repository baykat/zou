In addition to providing a space for memorial services, your employees form emotional bonds with families, guiding them through the grief process, and building loyalty.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In death care, where your business is ingrained in the community, building and <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.johnsonconsulting.com\/is-your-funeral-business-equipped-to-maintain-quality-talent\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">maintaining a talented team<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is essential to your survival. Here\u2019s how to make sure your best people stick around.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">1. Offer an Incentive Compensation Plan<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">By tying a portion of bonus pay to performance, you\u2019ll positively reinforce behaviors that benefit your business. While <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.johnsonconsulting.com\/4-components-incentive-compensation-plan\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">incentive compensation<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> can take a variety of forms, you\u2019ll want to make sure your plan is:<\/span><b><\/b><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li aria-level=\"1\"><b>Understandable: <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Create clear and simple benchmarks with articulated benefits for your team members.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<ul>\n<li aria-level=\"1\"><b>Fair: <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Benchmarks to obtain extra compensation should be realistically achievable.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<ul>\n<li aria-level=\"1\"><b>Measurable: <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Metrics like client satisfaction can be difficult to quantify, so you\u2019ll want to figure out how to measure success in areas like this. Online reviews might offer an outlet.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<ul>\n<li aria-level=\"1\"><b>Consistent: <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Implement regular bonus payouts, and keep your incentivized compensation structure the same throughout the year.<\/span><\/span>&nbsp;<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">2. Make Them Want to Come to Work<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Highly engaged employees lead to increases in performance, and that starts with creating a positive work culture.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In addition to closely monitoring feedback from families, you\u2019ll also want to consider\u2013\u2013and regularly solicit\u2013\u2013feedback from your team. Augmenting employee benefits, providing flexible time-off policies, and offering career growth opportunities will all help make your employees more excited to come to work.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To increase collaborative abilities, you might also consider the occasional team-building activity. Happy hours and other bonding events can do wonders towards building connections within your team that will ultimately make them work more effectively together.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Alternatively, if you\u2019re in your office with the door shut all day, you\u2019re not creating a welcoming space. Employees should know that you care about their well-being, both in and outside of work.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">3. Be Agile\u00a0<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With a rise in the popularity of cremations, green burials, and virtual services, recent years have shown us that the funeral business is quickly evolving. As such, it\u2019s imperative to remain open to new ideas\u2013\u2013especially those that affect your employees\u2019 work-life balances.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ultimately, you\u2019ll want to make sure that each of your team members feels heard. This could mean creating a five-year plan of growth for a team member.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Never underestimate the power of listening to your employees. If they feel that they are contributing to the funeral home in a bigger way, you\u2019ll be more likely to earn their buy-in and loyalty.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">4. Trust Them<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As we all know, trust is a two-way street. In addition to earning the trust of your employees\u2013\u2013which can be accomplished by following through on promises and living by your funeral home\u2019s values\u2013\u2013you\u2019ll also want to demonstrate to your team that you trust them.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Especially for those with small teams, it can be tempting to micromanage each employee; however, micromanagement <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.prnewswire.com\/news-releases\/survey-more-than-half-of-employees-have-worked-for-a-micromanager-265359491.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">decreases both morale and productivity<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. In many cases, employees will feel insulted by this invasive management strategy and, as a result, search for new work.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Instead, you should adopt a management strategy that guides and supports your team without dictating each of their actions. By giving your team members the autonomy to do their jobs on their own terms, you\u2019ll likely increase their workplace engagement.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">5. Give Them a Future<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Maintaining talent takes more than giving them immediate opportunities. The most driven employees will naturally want to plan out their future, and it\u2019s your job to make sure these plans involve your funeral home.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One effective way to accomplish this is to regularly meet with each of your employees. During these meetings, you can discuss future goals. If this career path involves the death care profession, you can work out ways to provide growth opportunities in your business.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For example, a new employee might have an interest in embalming. With your assistance, you can provide on-the-job experience with this role and maybe consider paying for a portion of the required coursework for this skill. When it\u2019s all done, you\u2019ll have created a more highly skilled worker who can use this experience to benefit your business.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Maintain Quality Talent<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Composed of seasoned experts in the death care profession, Johnson Consulting Group understands the importance of talent and can help your business to retain it.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Our consultants can take a comprehensive look at your funeral home, examining its performance, customer satisfaction, and employees.
