In 2016 they surveyed roughly 120,000 families that experienced a death across the USA and Canada. This large amount of survey data has proven invaluable to providing insight into customer needs and satisfaction. It also allows for standards of excellence benchmarking based on call volume, geography, demographics, ethnicity and business type. The company attributes its rapid growth based on its ability to offer the program with no contract to sign, a low monthly cost and accessibility to its management professionals for interpretation and usefulness of the reports.<\/p>\n<p>Jake Johnson says \u201cIt is imperative to have a means to measure the services a funeral home provides to its families, and to have actionable reports to act on when necessary. Our client funeral homes get that with Performance Tracker\u2122 and more.\u201d The JCG Performance Tracker also has a sales analysis component that when tied to the survey measurement provides an all in tool to help manage your business. \u201cWe find more and more of our customers are taking the next step and using the data to implement our incentive compensation program along with these results\u201d\u2026\u201dCombined, these are powerful tools for promoting high levels of customers satisfaction and average sale at client funeral homes\u201d says Jake Johnson.<\/p>\n<p>To review Johnson Consulting Group\u2019s key findings and insights from its Performance Tracker\u2122 data, or if you would like to learn more about the JCG Performance Tracker\u2122 and how it can help your firm, please contact Samantha Tracey at (480) 556-8500 or <a href=\"mailto:stracey@johnsonconsulting.com\">stracey@johnsonconsulting.com<\/a>.
