During this time, you can gauge their satisfaction and course-correct if good employees are feeling burnt out or they can\u2019t picture a future at your business.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While official reviews provide a great opportunity to give feedback to team members, it\u2019s important to treat these meetings as a dialogue. Rather than rattle off a list of what a person did well and what needs improvement, take some time to see how they feel about their workplace and set some tangible goals for the latter part of the year.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Check on Goals<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Whether you\u2019re hoping to <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.johnsonconsulting.com\/increase-your-preneed-sales-with-these-7-tips\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">increase preneed sales<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, obtain a certain valuation, or expand into cremation services, the middle of the year offers the opportunity to measure your progress.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For example, if one of your 2022 goals was to introduce an <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.johnsonconsulting.com\/4-components-incentive-compensation-plan\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">incentive compensation program<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, you\u2019ll want to check in on how this has affected your business. Have employees been engaging with this program? Based on your rate of return, does the extra payroll expenditure seem to be worth it? Are there any changes that you\u2019d like to make going forward?\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If everything is going as you\u2019d like, then you might consider doubling down on your efforts. If something seems amiss, it\u2019s a good time to reset.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Review the Budget<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While you\u2019re hopefully meeting with your accountant on a more regular basis than twice per year, mid-year financial reporting can go one step deeper.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In addition to pulling cash flow, net income, and the other usual suspects, you might also consider <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.johnsonconsulting.com\/consistent-funeral-home-valuation-important\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">conducting a valuation<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. This is especially useful if you set ambitious growth goals for 2022.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Analyze Feedback<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the death care profession, it\u2019s essential that you know how each of your families feels about their funeral services.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Because of this, you\u2019ll want to take a closer look at any in-house surveys that you give to families. Take note of any trends. For example, you might find that many families praise your immaculate facilities while others routinely point out dissatisfaction with the planning process.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Online reviews from social media and Google can also come into play here.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If your funeral home lacks sufficient data to observe feedback trends, then now is the time to increase your efforts. By <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.j3techsolutions.com\/paper-vs-digital-surveys-what-is-more-impactful\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">administering digital surveys<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to families, you can ensure higher rates of compliance, as well as detailed tracking mechanisms.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ensuring You&#8217;re On The Right Track<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you\u2019re not sure where to begin examining your funeral home, or you notice issues but don\u2019t know how to fix them, then it might be time to call in some expert guidance. Not only are most funeral directors busy, but they\u2019re also so enmeshed with day-to-day processes making it difficult to gain objective expertise. This is where consultants come into play.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At Johnson Consulting Group, our team of death care consultants has more than a century of collective experience in various death care roles, owning, managing, and <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.johnsonconsulting.com\/selling-alone-vs-funeral-home-broker\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">selling funeral businesses<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> throughout the country.
