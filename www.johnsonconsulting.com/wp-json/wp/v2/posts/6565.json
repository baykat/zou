These expansions hold the potential to not only increase revenue but also diversify income streams; however, they must be implemented strategically.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you expand your funeral home without a thorough understanding of its costs, legalities, and required expertise, then you risk wasting a whole lot of time and money. Before breaking ground, you should always conduct a feasibility study.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What is a Feasibility Study?<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A feasibility study is a formal assessment used to determine the practicality of a potential project. It analyzes all aspects of an endeavor and determines whether or not it is likely to succeed.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For example, if a funeral director wishes to acquire a local competitor, the associated feasibility study would likely consist of a cash flow analysis, an assessment of risk, and projections of income, among other factors.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Benefits of a Feasibility Study<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When thoroughly conducted, a feasibility study gives you all the information you need to determine whether a project is worth pursuing. Benefits include:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Identify reasons for and against proceeding with a project.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sharpen the focus of your project team.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Provide actionable steps to begin a project.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Provide accurate estimates of required resources.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Calculate the return on your investment.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What Should Be Included in a Feasibility Study?<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When looking to expand your funeral home, the associated feasibility study will include the following:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"list-style-type: none;\">\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Executive summary:<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Briefly outline your plan for expansion.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Technological considerations:<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Depending on the type of expansion\u2013\u2013particularly if you plan to build new facilities\u2013\u2013you\u2019ll want to consider the technology needed, if you already have it, and how much it will cost.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Current marketplace:<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Analyze the current market for funeral services and project how your expansion might affect this ecosystem.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Marketing strategy:<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Describe how you plan to publicize your expansion, ensuring the right clients are aware of any new services involved.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Required staffing:<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Consider what an expansion means in terms of staffing. Will you have to hire new team members? Will they need any specialized training? How will your existing team members fit into this equation?<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Schedule and timeline:<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Include an outline for key benchmarks of your expansion, from the beginning to completion.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<ul>\n<li aria-level=\"1\"><b>Project financials: <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Create an itemized budget for the project, including manpower, labor, licenses, and any other associated costs.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Findings and recommendations:<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Drawing on each of the prior components, this portion of the feasibility study will both conclude if an expansion is worth it and provide actionable steps to begin the project.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How to Conduct a Feasibility Study<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For a funeral home expansion, a feasibility study will generally consist of five steps.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Step 1: Conduct a Preliminary Analysis<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A preliminary analysis essentially functions as a condensed version of a feasibility study. Since a feasibility study can take weeks or months to complete, this step of the process can help you quickly identify which projects justify further examination.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In a preliminary analysis, you\u2019ll first want to outline the basics of your expansion. This will likely consist of real estate, facilities, and services, culminating in the ultimate goals of the project. Make sure to look at the greater marketplace of your funeral home. Examine your competitive advantages and also look at similar expansions carried out by competitors and how they have performed.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">During this step, you\u2019ll also determine the risks of expanding your business. This includes financial risks, in addition to issues related to staffing, supplies, and anything else that could threaten the success of your expansion.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Step 2: Create a Scope<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Once you\u2019ve got a basic understanding of your expansion, you\u2019ll want to delve more deeply into its technical components by outlining its scope. This consists of answering the following questions:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"list-style-type: none;\">\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Is this expansion technically feasible?<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"2\"><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Will you need to acquire any new technology to successfully expand?<\/span><\/i><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"list-style-type: none;\">\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Is this expansion legal?<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"2\"><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Are there any licenses, certifications, or other legal requirements to consider?<\/span><\/i><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"list-style-type: none;\">\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Is this expansion operationally feasible?<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"2\"><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Do you have the staffing (both in numbers and individual skillsets) to pull it off?\u00a0<\/span><\/i><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"list-style-type: none;\">\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Can this expansion be completed within a reasonable timeframe?<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"2\"><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ideally, when would your expansion be complete?<\/span><\/i><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"list-style-type: none;\">\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Is this expansion economically feasible?<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"2\"><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Do you have the funds to conduct this expansion, and will the returns be worth it?<\/span><\/i><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Step 3: Perform Market Research<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/blog.hubspot.com\/marketing\/market-research-buyers-journey-guide\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Conducting market research<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> means to gather information about your target audience to determine if your expansion would be well-received, if it\u2019s needed\/wanted, and how you might iterate the project to fit your family\u2019s needs.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A tangential benefit to market research is that in provides insight into many other areas that can be useful to you, such as:\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What\u2019s trending according to families<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Competitors that are looked to as a leader in death care and why<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the entirety of the local death care market, the main challenges faced by funeral homes<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Determining if there is demand for the expansion you\u2019re proposing<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Family needs that are not being met<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The idea of market research is to get the pulse of local families\u2013how they feel about your current funeral home and their interest if it were to expand.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Step 4: Financial Analysis<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In most cases, the financial component will be the most important in determining the feasibility of an expansion. While the financial concerns will look entirely different for every expansion, you\u2019ll want to consider the following:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Will you fund your expansion internally or through external financing?\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If your expansion were to fail or underperform, what would be the potential costs?<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Which risks pose the largest financial issues for your expansion budget?<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Once your expansion is complete, at what financial point will you break even?<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Weighing all risks, how much money will you need to complete your expansion?<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When completing this step, it\u2019s important to remember that\u2013\u2013no matter how carefully you plan\u2013\u2013most projects and expansions will go over budget. So it\u2019s important to provide yourself with some added flexibility in your allocations.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Step 5: Review Results<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Once you\u2019ve figured out the scope, market, and financial concerns of your expansion, it\u2019s time to compile your results and present them to key stakeholders. From this presentation, you should be able to conclusively state whether or not an expansion is worth it, supporting this conclusion with ample evidence.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Feasibility Study Best Practices<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Each expansion requires a slightly different approach to determining feasibility; however, you\u2019ll undoubtedly want to follow some best practices:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Your preliminary analysis should include feedback from funeral home stakeholders. It should also consider similar expansions from other businesses and how they succeeded or failed and why.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ensure the financial data is valid. Check, double check, triple check.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If possible, conduct original market surveys to better understand how your expansion might fit into current funeral home trends.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Create an exhaustive list of obstacles to your expansion and contingency plans to mitigate them.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Get a Third Party Involved<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A key tenant of feasibility studies is attention to detail. To thoroughly analyze market trends, your funeral home\u2019s position, and how an expansion can increase your reach requires expertise and time. Often, a feasibility study can take 2-3 months to complete, making it beneficial to call in some outside help.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.johnsonconsulting.com\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Johnson Consulting Group<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, we have decades of experience owning, operating, and growing funeral businesses of all sizes.
