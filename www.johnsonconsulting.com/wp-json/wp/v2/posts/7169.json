Since most employees expect a yearly raise of some sort, you\u2019ll also want to account for additional monies being spent in this manner. Potentially, you might even recognize high-performing team members with promotions.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While it might seem unnecessary to give out compulsory raises to everyone, these yearly raises are an important component of employee retention. Some studies show that to replace an employee, it costs <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.peoplekeep.com\/blog\/employee-retention-the-real-cost-of-losing-an-employee#:~:text=The%20cost%20of%20employee%20turnover%20is%20high&amp;text=Some%20studies4%20predict%20that,in%20recruiting%20and%20training%20expenses.\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">roughly six to nine months of their salary<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to recruit and train a new person.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For example, if a team member is paid $80,000, you can expect to pay about $40,000-$60,000 in recruiting and training expenses. In light of these numbers, a <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.thebalancemoney.com\/the-scoop-on-salary-increases-1919079#:~:text=The%20average%20annual%20pay%20raise,in%20your%20pay%20raise%20negotiations.\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">standard raise of about 5%<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> looks much more appealing, especially if you\u2019re pleased with a team member\u2019s performance.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Marketing<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Unless you want your business growth to stagnate, then you\u2019ll need to develop a marketing strategy that not only retains current customers but also attracts new ones. While you won\u2019t necessarily need to hire a full-time marketing manager, you\u2019ll definitely need to allot for marketing-related expenditures.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For starters, this will likely include managing or (if you haven\u2019t already) creating a <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.funeralresultsmarketing.com\/funeral-home-websites\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">website for your funeral business<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Here, visitors will be able to find contact information for your business, as well as a variety of informative posts that establish trust with your brand.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Additionally, you might consider conducting market research in the form of sending surveys to your families. By obtaining feedback from prior clients\u2013\u2013even if only a fraction of them respond\u2013\u2013you\u2019ll gain valuable insight into where your business excels and where it needs to focus.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One cost-effective way to administer these surveys is through digital platforms. The <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.j3techsolutions.com\/performance-tracker\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Performance Tracker X<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> from J3Tech is a software solution built specifically for death care businesses. With this tool, you can create digital surveys, send them to families via email, and automatically track their responses.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Business Growth and Improvement<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A large portion of your funeral home\u2019s strategic budget planning should be set aside for business growth initiatives. Anything that will improve your business and make it better or more profitable will fall into this bucket.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This might include investing in new technology that improves customer experience, adding new services like green burials or cremation, or even renovating your facilities. To figure out where to focus your efforts, you\u2019ll want to rely heavily on feedback from families, as they\u2019ll likely be able to provide you with key insights related to your services.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Additionally, on the back end of things, you might consider investing in training for your team members. Particularly when it comes to your high-performing employees, helping them acquire new skills will allow them to take on new responsibilities (adding value to your business) while further engaging them with your workplace.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Johnson Consulting Group, a leading death care consulting firm, offers a variety of personalized training courses for <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.johnsonconsulting.com\/services\/jcg-academy\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">leadership and management skills<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. While these courses do cost money, the results will be well worth your investment.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Plan for Success With JCG<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Oftentimes, business owners don\u2019t know where to begin when it comes to yearly funeral home strategic planning.
