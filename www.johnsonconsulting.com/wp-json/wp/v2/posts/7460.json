Death care is also considered a recession-proof profession, as funeral home spending remains relatively constant even during times of economic downturn.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To harken back to Benjamin Franklin\u2019s quote, people are always in need of ways to honor the passing of their loved ones. While the exact preferences in the type of memorial may fluctuate over time, the fact remains that people will always need the assistance of funeral professionals to plan services, execute burials, and aid in the grieving process.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Purchasing or Launching a New Business\u00a0<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you\u2019re considering owning a funeral home, then you\u2019ll have two ways to enter the profession: either purchasing an existing funeral home or building a new business from scratch.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.johnsonconsulting.com\/how-to-buy-a-funeral-home\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Buying a funeral home<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is undoubtedly the simpler and quicker option. With this approach, you\u2019ll need to partner with an industry consultant that will help you navigate the process of finding, vetting, and negotiating the sale of the business. The primary downside of purchasing an existing business will be adapting its infrastructure (facilities, employees, and operations) to your vision.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.johnsonconsulting.com\/diving-into-the-requirements-to-open-a-funeral-home\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Building a funeral home from scratch<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> naturally comes with a lot more work and expense, as you\u2019ll need to purchase property, hire employees, and develop an entirely new business strategy. However, for those who are unafraid of the lengthy process, this approach can allow you to create a business that\u2019s completely aligned with your vision.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Regardless of how you plan to start a business, professionals like those at JCG can guide you through the accompanying strategic decisions. Whether you\u2019re building or purchasing a funeral business, financials, employee management, and marketing can all benefit from some outside help.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href='https:\/\/www.johnsonconsulting.com\/contact-us\/' class='small-button smallblue'>GET IN TOUCH TODAY<\/a><\/span><\/p>\n<h2><\/h2>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">6 Tips for Improving Funeral Home Profits<\/span><\/h2>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">1. Create a Business Plan\u00a0<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At the onset of creating your funeral business\u2014whether you\u2019re building from scratch or purchasing an existing funeral home\u2014you\u2019ll need to <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.johnsonconsulting.com\/grow-and-build-value-the-business-lifecycle-in-action\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">create a business plan<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Along with drafting a mission and your values, your business plan should also include tangible financial goals and timelines. As your funeral home continues to operate, you can reexamine these goals to better understand how you\u2019re performing.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><\/h3>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">2. Marketing<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While people continually need the help of funeral homes, your business will likely not be the only option available in a given region. Because of this, you\u2019ll need to <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.johnsonconsulting.com\/funeral-home-marketing-ideas\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">develop a marketing strategy<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u2014one that incorporates social media, a well-designed website, and SEO practices\u2014to ensure that your ideal families find your services and feel compelled to book.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><\/h3>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">3. Customer Service<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.johnsonconsulting.com\/build-lasting-relationships-with-quality-customer-service\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Quality customer service<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is arguably the most important component of your business. If a family has a positive experience with your funeral home, then they\u2019re not only <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.johnsonconsulting.com\/4-ways-to-ensure-consistent-customer-retention\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">likely to return<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, but they\u2019ll also likely recommend your business to friends.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Because of this, funeral directors need to implement a strategy to collect and monitor feedback from families. This allows a business to quickly address issues and build upon areas of strength.\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><\/h3>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">4.

By networking with local mortuary schools and looking to funeral profession job boards, you can find highly skilled individuals that bring value to your team.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Once you\u2019ve acquired the right people, you\u2019ll also want to <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.johnsonconsulting.com\/4-components-incentive-compensation-plan\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">create incentive compensation plans<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> as well as <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.johnsonconsulting.com\/everything-you-need-to-know-about-jcgs-workshop-and-training-options\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">offer career development opportunities<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to ensure that personnel want to stick around.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><\/h3>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">5. Add New Services<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While people will always need funeral homes to help them honor the passing of loved ones, the specific ways in which they wish to accomplish this goal are subject to change. Because of this, funeral homes need to remain aware of trends and consider introducing new services into their offerings when appropriate.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For example, during the pandemic, in-person gatherings were impossible to conduct safely. Many funeral businesses began offering webcasted memorials in which people could remotely attend a service and pay their respects. Now, with in-person gatherings resuming, many funeral homes offer the option of adding a virtual component to a memorial service, which allows those who live far away to still attend.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Offering new products like these can put extra money in your pocket as well as demonstrate to families that <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.johnsonconsulting.com\/heres-what-we-can-expect-from-funeral-and-cemetery-families-in-2023\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">your funeral home is on the cutting edge<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><\/h3>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">6. Partner with a Funeral Home Consultant<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Whether you\u2019re purchasing a funeral business or building one from scratch, stepping into the role of business ownership is highly challenging. To ensure that you\u2019re adeptly handling every component of the process, it\u2019s often best to get advice from death care experts.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.johnsonconsulting.com\/services\/business-consulting\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Johnson Consulting Group<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> (JCG), a leading death care consulting firm, our experts can partner with your team to help with every stage of creating a funeral business.
