Solid growth strategies must be in place to ensure success. Here are 7 to consider.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">1. Analyze Your Performance<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Before you make significant changes to your funeral home, you\u2019ll want to perform a thorough analysis of your current performance. One effective way to accomplish this is through a <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.johnsonconsulting.com\/neglecting-a-swot-analysis-dont-do-it-heres-why\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">SWOT analysis of your funeral home<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. This method involves taking a comprehensive look at the strengths and weaknesses of your business, in addition to any threats and opportunities down the pipeline.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You might also choose to embark on more granular assessments of specific business components such as a performance analysis which reviews in detail your financial performance, customer service, workflow, and competitive market share.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While there are numerous ways to evaluate the performance of your business, getting started on one will start providing you with the insight you need to implement measures for improved performance.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">2. Review Your Workflow <\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Any outcome of your funeral home is a direct reflection on the effectiveness of the workflow and processes in place to achieve that result.\u00a0 From the moment the customer reaches out on the phone, to the meeting in person, to the instructions in the prep room, to coordinating all the service details, and culminating in the delivery and completion of the service\u2026These various handoffs to the \u201cinternal\u201d customer\/employee is critical.\u00a0 What does your workflow look like?\u00a0 Have you surveyed the staff and reviewed areas of communication breakdown for ineffective \u201chandoffs\u201d to the next employee or vendor?\u00a0 A workflow review is a great team building exercise and will bear improved customer service\u2026Guaranteed!<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">3. Create a Plan <\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After closely examining the positioning of your business\u2013\u2013and the components that have contributed to this\u2013\u2013you\u2019ll want to create a plan. Depending on the size of your business and your goals as its owner, your plan could be measured through a number of lenses.\u00a0 Perhaps you\u2019re looking to reach a certain valuation for your funeral home, or maybe you want to reach a new yearly goal for preneed sales. Regardless of your specific mission, you\u2019ll want to articulate exactly what you hope to accomplish and develop a set of tactical actions to bring about the fruition of your initiatives.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How is this all accomplished effectively?\u2026Through a strategic plan.\u00a0 There are right ways and wrong ways to conduct a strategic plan.\u00a0 The most obvious of wrong ways is for the owner or employee of the business to emcee it.\u00a0 You should hire an outsider with a clear agenda and prework.\u00a0 By doing this, you will create a plan as you have never before seen, with a high chance of success for your goals as an owner.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">4. Review your marketplace<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Apart from recouping the costs that go into providing funeral services, there is no set requirement for the pricing of your services. Because of this, a solid growth strategy should take into consideration the pricing structure of competitors.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In recent years, the notion of<\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.cnbc.com\/2019\/12\/07\/more-families-are-turning-to-crowdfunding-to-pay-for-funeral-costs.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">crowdfunding to pay<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> for funeral arrangements shows a trend that demonstrates that a growing number of customers struggle to afford these services. Because of this, you\u2019ll want to make sure your business considers package pricing.\u00a0 But be careful how your packages are created as they should simplify the process and offer savings but not at the sacrifice of your current average sale.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">5. Focus On Your Team<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When a family loses a loved one, they\u2019re usually focused on one thing\u2013\u2013comfort. Because of this, your team should be able to sell while displaying empathy and compassion. To address this, it\u2019s obvious that we must encourage our employees to deliver exceptional customer service. This can be measured not only through sales totals but also through client surveys and online reviews\u2013a task made easy by solutions like <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.j3techsolutions.com\/performance-tracker\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">J3 Tech\u2019s Performance Tracker<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">By taking into account the feedback of families in conjunction with each arranger\u2019s average sale and receivables collection practices you can be assured that there is compassionate selling you want in your team.\u00a0 Lastly, we highly encourage you to implement a Customer Service Culture Program.\u00a0 For more information on this program, reach out today!<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">6. Consistently Manage Performance<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yearly or quarterly reviews, while important, won\u2019t help you make the immediate changes needed to adapt to trends in real-time. Rather, these traditional forms of review are retroactive approaches that prevent on-the-fly change.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Instead, manage performance on an ongoing basis. One way to achieve this is through regular performance management meetings in which your team discusses current operations and collectively identifies any opportunities for improvement. By meeting more frequently, you can regularly monitor key metrics like customer satisfaction, market share, call volume, and team member performance.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If recent years have taught us anything, it\u2019s that the death care industry is not immune to shifting economic and religious trends. As such, it\u2019s important to ensure your team has the flexibility and \u201creal time feedback\u201d to adapt to these changes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">7. Lean on Death Care Experts<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For funeral directors, simply managing your team and relationships with families can occupy the majority of your time, making it difficult to set aside the effort required to develop and implement strategic improvements. This is why your best bet is to call in the assistance of death care professionals.\u00a0 We all have the same amount of time in the day and it\u2019s the one thing we nobody can create more of.\u00a0 However, the new trend is to focus on what you do well at and outsource the rest!\u00a0 Consider your time value as an owner\u2026I bet if you put an hourly rate to it, it would be quite high!\u00a0 Are you best utilized doing some of the things you do at that hourly rate?&#8230;probably not and we are all guilty of it.\u00a0 You want to scale? You want to grow?\u00a0 You want to find more time for yourself?\u00a0 You must outsource!<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.johnsonconsulting.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Johnson Consulting Group<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, our team of consultants has worked in the death care profession for decades, owning and operating a variety of funeral businesses throughout the country.
