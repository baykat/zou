Afterall, society continues to evolve which leads to family\u2019s needs changing. We saw this happen in just the past two years with all of the shifts brought on by the pandemic.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Forbes,<\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.forbes.com\/sites\/markcperna\/2022\/04\/12\/why-learning--development-is-now-a-competitive-differentiator-and-how-to-get-on-board\/?sh=46824f6630ff\"> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">more than half the workforce<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> wants training to perform better in their current roles. With the great resignation continuing to pose a threat, as well as labor shortages,\u00a0 keeping quality talent in your doors is more important than ever. Investing in their long term education is a great way to keep them engaged.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At JCG we are big believers in lifelong learning in funeral service. We are constantly staying on top of trends so we can bring out clients the latest and greatest strategies geared specifically towards the profession. We\u2019ve created additional learning courses for those in funeral service looking to step up their game and grow. Here\u2019s everything you need to know about what we offer.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><b>Leadership and Management<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This program is specifically designed for up-and-coming leaders and managers within a funeral home or cemetery. It will give individuals the tools they need to be successful in the next phase of their career.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Each workshop is followed up with three weeks of one-on-one coaching sessions with JCG\u2019s experienced business consultants to further your learning through our team&#8217;s operational experience in leading funeral homes, cemeteries, large care centers, successful pre-need programs, and more.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Objective\u00a0<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This course takes place in two sessions that are both two days long. The first session focused heavily on Leadership. We will dive into what kind of leader you are right now, and how you can grow to reach your full potential.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We explore questions such as:\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What does it mean to be an effective leader within a funeral home or cemetery business?<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00a0How does one effectively communicate with their team and motivate them toward higher levels of performance?<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Our second session shifts to Management, where we dive into the fundamentals of revenue and expenses at funeral home businesses. After walking through this session students will be provided with tools for budgeting and good financial stewardship that they can apply to their own finances and operations.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Method<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Participate in a unique boardroom experience with a peer group of professionals who are furthering their career in funeral and\/or cemetery management and have similar goals and experiences. We have specifically designed this class to be smaller ( 8 students max) to create an in-depth, personalized learning experience for each student.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We have found there are many shared experiences among the participants, making the group discussions an incredibly valuable learning atmosphere. Participants are also able to build their professional network which are resources for them and their firms in the future.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><\/h3>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3><strong>Workshop Details<\/strong><\/h3>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Upcoming Opportunities:\u00a0<\/span><\/h3>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Next Available Dates:<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> March 6-7, 2024 (Leadership Development Session) &amp; May 15-16, 2024 (Business Development Session)<\/span>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"2\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Custom Engagements are also available upon request <\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<li><b>Where:<\/b> Scottsdale, Arizona<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">All meals are provided during the course as well as group rates are negotiated at the Scottsdale McCormick Ranch Resort.
