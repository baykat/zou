As well as displaying contact information and showcasing the expertise of your staff, a funeral home website can be a valuable tool for generating revenue and selling and growing your sales.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">By taking the time to create a smooth user experience and provide options for online selections, a website can become an integral source of outreach and ecommerce revenue. Here are some tips for success.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Enticing, User-Friendly Website<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Just as your grounds and facilities create a first impression for in-person clients, your website does the same for online visitors, effectively serving as your digital storefront. With this in mind, you\u2019ll want to make sure it\u2019s presentable. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For starters, you\u2019ll want to include some helpful images and videos that showcase the strengths of your funeral home. Consider including photos of your leadership and staff. You might even throw in a video walkthrough of your facilities, helping users understand how a service might look with your business.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Finally, your website should also be easy to use. This part might take some trial and error, but optimization is worth the effort. Ideally, when a user visits your website, there will be clearly displayed links to contacting your business, learning more about its history, and even selecting atneed and preneed arrangements.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Online Shopping (E-Commerce)<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Funeral services usually require in-person consultations, during at which time clients select their type of service and gain more information about pricing. However, a growing number of people <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/maristpoll.marist.edu\/wp-content\/misc\/usapolls\/us180423_NPR\/NPR_Marist%20Poll_Tables%20of%20Questions_May%202018.pdf\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">prefer to shop online<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, particularly younger generations.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To meet the needs of this type of client, your website should allow people to select services online. For example, a website built by <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.funeralresultsmarketing.com\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Funeral Results Marketing<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is a modern, user-friendly experience that helps visitors discover your funeral home, access the information they need, and begin browsing your services.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For example, if a person is looking for a cremation package, they should be able to schedule and pay for it online through your <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.funeralresultsmarketing.com\/cremation-arrangement-websites\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">cremation arrangement website<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Alternatively, people should be able to book standardized funeral packages online when appropriate.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Particularly when it comes to selling preneed funeral arrangements, offering them online greatly increases the chances of people completing a purchase. People may not know you can pre-arrange funeral services, and displaying this option on your website can help increase the visibility of this offering.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Naturally, death care rituals require a level of individualization that\u2019s difficult to accomplish without consultation. There\u2019s hardly a one-size-fits-all approach to funerals; however, your online offerings can serve as base packages. Once your team makes contact with an interested family, you can then discuss additional customization options.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Transparent Pricing<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Before making a purchase, the <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.invoca.com\/blog\/retail-marketing-statistics\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">vast majority of shoppers conduct research<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, including comparing prices between vendors. Because of this, it\u2019s important to <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.johnsonconsulting.com\/the-dos-and-donts-of-budgeting-and-strategic-pricing-initiatives\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">display prices on your website<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When a person has no idea what they can expect to pay for a funeral service, they\u2019re less likely to follow through and select your business. Alternatively, having a price displayed, even if it only represents a base rate, can make them feel more confident about making a purchase. Even if your website price isn\u2019t the lowest, the act of displaying a price allows you to demonstrate your value and transparency, noting exactly what\u2019s included with each service.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Marketing<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Your website will also play a key role in any type of <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.johnsonconsulting.com\/funeral-home-marketing-ideas\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">digital marketing<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. If you plan to run ads on Google, Bing, Facebook, Instagram, or other social media, they\u2019ll inevitably link back to your website. Ideally, your ads and website will work hand-in-hand, the former directing them to your site and the latter compelling them to select a service.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Additionally, your website can organically gain traffic by targeting relevant keywords. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Use your site&#8217;s blog section to create informative and useful content about death care. Your site will begin to rank more highly in online searches, ultimately increasing your business&#8217; visibility and customer base.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Consultation Services with JCG<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Managing a website can easily become a full-time job. After all, many larger businesses devote entire teams to building and overseeing their web presence.
