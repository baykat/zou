If your team members aren\u2019t engaged with their work, then they\u2019ll likely look elsewhere for employment, leaving you high and dry when they give you their notice.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">By taking an active approach to <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.johnsonconsulting.com\/employee-engagement\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">employee engagement<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, incentivizing optimal performance, and creating opportunities for advancement, you can ensure that your best team members stick around for the long haul.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Analyze the Current Situation<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For leadership, it\u2019s often difficult to accurately gauge employee satisfaction. Even if team members are struggling with certain components of their work life, they might not feel comfortable raising concerns with their superiors.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Because of this, funeral directors and managers should develop a system for regularly collecting feedback from staff. Through this process, leadership will be able to get a clearer sense of how employees perceive their working conditions. Perhaps some team members feel overworked, while others crave additional challenges and responsibilities.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The feedback you collect from employees during 1:1 meetings, employee satisfaction meetings, and <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.johnsonconsulting.com\/annual-reviews-the-ultimate-staff-evaluation-checklist\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">employee reviews<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> will help inform you on any changes you decide to make to your workflow, operational structure, and employee benefits.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Invest in Your People<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Studies consistently show that workplaces that offer employee training programs <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/teamstage.io\/training-statistics\/#:~:text=Companies%20that%20invest%20in%20training,training%20to%20do%20their%20job.\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">have higher retention rates<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Because of this, funeral managers should sit down with each of their employees and help them chart out a career path within the workplace.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">By developing these career paths, leaders can gain a greater understanding of their team members\u2019 various interests, skills, and desires, ultimately learning how each team member can continue to grow in the workplace.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">From there, leadership can devise various educational means to help these team members acquire new skills, whether this be on-the-job training or tuition reimbursement for outside courses or certifications. When your team members acquire new skills, they can bring these skills back to your business and drive additional revenue growth.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Training and career development doesn\u2019t just apply to your employees. Investing<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.johnsonconsulting.com\/services\/jcg-academy\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">leadership and management training<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> can help your leadership team foster a supportive and productive environment for the rest of your employees.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Offer Incentives<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Another way to improve employee engagement is through the use of <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.johnsonconsulting.com\/4-components-incentive-compensation-plan\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">incentive compensation plans<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. This strategy rewards employees with additional compensation when your funeral home achieves certain financial and <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.johnsonconsulting.com\/how-to-improve-customer-experience-from-the-first-interaction\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">customer satisfaction<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> goals.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For example, many companies will reward employees with quarterly bonuses that are tied to the overall profitability of the enterprise. This creates greater stakes for each individual to ensure the success of the business.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Still even more effective, however, are individualized employee incentive programs. Particularly for sales and client-facing roles, offering commission or bonus structures on an individual basis can help stir up some extra ambition and reward high performance. For example, if a person receives a bonus for meeting certain sales and customer service metrics, then they\u2019ll be more likely to shoot for this number.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That said, you\u2019ll want to be sure that incentive programs are fair, consistent, and easy to understand. When implemented hastily, employee incentive programs can be gamed, or they can lead to inter-employee competition that ultimately hurts your business.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Bring Strategic Incentives and Engagement to Your Business<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In order to create a successful incentive compensation program, you\u2019ll need to consider the goals of your funeral home, as well as the culture of your team. While these programs can spur optimal performance, unattainable goals can just as easily discourage or frustrate your team.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To ensure that your incentive compensation plan \u2014 as well as other employee engagement measures \u2014 go off without a hitch, you should call in some outside expert help.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At Johnson Consulting Group, we specialize in helping death care businesses of any size adapt to the changing landscape of employee engagements.
