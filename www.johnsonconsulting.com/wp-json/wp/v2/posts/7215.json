It\u2019s important that owners, managers, and staff alike are on the same page regarding <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.ftc.gov\/system\/files\/ftc_gov\/pdf\/P034410FuneralRuleANPR.pdf\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">updates happening within the FTC<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and have the right knowledge to prepare for what could be ahead.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">History<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In 1982, the <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Funeral Rule<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> was introduced to the Federal Trade Commission and went into effect the following April. It had two original goals, to lower barriers to competition regarding pricing in the funeral market and encourage informed consumer choice. It basically ensures that consumers have access to information, aren\u2019t required by law to make a purchase, and that no misrepresentation happens to inform their decision making.\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">All of those above points are important, and it\u2019s our job as funeral professionals to guide our families in the right direction. However, the FTC has started to realize that technology and our society is changing at a rapid pace. They&#8217;re looking to potentially make amendments to the rule to keep up with today\u2019s consumer.\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Dilemma\u00a0<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It\u2019s no secret the profession is evolving with today\u2019s family, which is why we need to be at the forefront of knowing what today\u2019s family needs. A study done by the Consumer Federation of America (CFA) and the Funeral Consumers Alliance (FCA) found that only 16% of funeral homes were posting their general price list online. Just four years later, the<\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.ftc.gov\/system\/files\/ftc_gov\/pdf\/P034410ShoppingFuneralServicesOnlineReport.pdf\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> FTC conducted their own study <\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">and found that number now lives at around 40%. Although that number has grown and has become more widely accepted by those in our profession, is it enough?\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The original rule requires funeral homes to provide anyone seeking services with an itemized price information list. However, this rule doesn\u2019t require pricing information to be available online or through any digital channel.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This rule was created over 40 years ago, before the internet was used on a daily basis by consumers. Our way of life has changed, and everyone is doing their shopping online. In fact, just in 2022 alone, here are <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/optinmonster.com\/online-shopping-statistics\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">some statistics <\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">to prove just how much consumers are shopping online:\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">25% of Americans make a purchase online once per month.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">88% of customers want detailed product pages to help their purchasing decisions<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">65% of shoppers compare pricing online before walking into a location<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Bottom line: consumers expect visible pricing.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Steps to Modernize<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Federal Trade Commission is exploring how they can make changes to the rule to better align it with the use of consumer technology.

The world has heavily adapted to this technological shift, and people are used to having information shared and readily available, especially upcoming generations. In fact, they really won\u2019t know life without it.\u00a0 The only way companies can have continued success is to adapt to the future. The more transparent and the more you share the more you are trusted.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Funeral businesses are unfortunately known for being behind in the trends when it comes to customer expectations. A real wake up moment for us was during the rise of technology and the pressure applied to using it through covid. It left some funeral businesses with no choice but to adapt.\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The bottom line is, pricing is not everything \u2013 consumers understand that as well. However, if you aren\u2019t making your pricing readily available and easy to access, that\u2019s a strike against you if your competition has it. How it\u2019s displayed on your website and how you describe your services matters are more important than ever as we head towards this change.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">About FRM<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.funeralresultsmarketing.com\/\">Funeral Results Marketing<\/a> provides solutions to help you with your digital presence.
