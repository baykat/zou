Through years of building relationships with families, they could maintain a healthy and lucrative business. With the rising popularity of alternative burial services\u2013\u2013with cremations becoming the norm\u2013\u2013new funeral homes are popping up, and the competition is intensifying, even in smaller markets.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Because of this, it\u2019s time for funeral businesses to start thinking outside of the box. To make sure that your community knows who you are and the services you offer, you\u2019ll want to adopt these modern funeral home marketing ideas.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Social Media (Behind the Scenes)<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you haven\u2019t already created social media accounts\u2013\u2013or your existing profiles are gathering dust\u2013\u2013then it\u2019s time to rethink your approach to this valuable media. Whether through Instagram, Facebook, or even TikTok, social media offers you to connect with potential clients before they ever book a service.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The best business social media accounts work to humanize a business. This can be accomplished in a number of ways. Perhaps you could post photos and profiles of key team members to demonstrate their expertise. Alternatively, you could post video walkthroughs of your facilities, giving people an up-close view of your grounds.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A great example is a Syracuse-based mortician, Eileen Hollis, who populates <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.tiktok.com\/@hollisfuneralhome?\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">her TikTok profile<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> with Q&amp;A videos, post-mortem makeup demonstrations, and interviews of coworkers.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Even if you don\u2019t have the vivacious charisma of someone like Hollis, you surely have the expertise that can interest viewers. People are inherently fascinated by death, and they\u2019re curious about the work that you do. One easy way to start would be through live Q&amp;A sessions on the social channel of your choice. This way, you can start developing your digital voice and engaging with those in the community.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Blog Content\u00a0<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Similar to social media usage, blog content can also go a long way towards both humanizing your business and interesting readers. By filling a blog with useful articles and guides, you\u2019ll not only demonstrate your knowledge, but you\u2019ll also boost your position in Google search rankings.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Builds Trust<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A well-written blog section on your website helps members of your community to trust you. If they visit your page and see informative writing, they\u2019ll be more likely to have faith in your services.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Additionally, a blog section can help you <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.johnsonconsulting.com\/funeral-home-strategies-partnerships\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">secure business partnerships<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Consider linking to local businesses that are likely used by your clients, like florists, senior homes, and hospice agencies.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">SEO<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nowadays, when a person needs funeral arrangements, they\u2019ll most likely hop on Google and search: <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">funeral home near me<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> (or something similar). Because of this, it\u2019s essential that your business\u2019s website appears near the top of these search results. After all, studies show that <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/backlinko.com\/google-ctr-stats\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">less than 1% of searchers<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> will click a link past the first page.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While optimizing your SEO is a multifarious and time-consuming process, a blog section is one of the simplest ways to get started. By populating your page with helpful content, Google will be more likely to send users your way. To get started, consider funeral-adjacent topics that might interest your community.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Some topics to consider:<\/span><i><\/i><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How to Write a Meaningful Eulogy<\/span><\/i><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Discussing Death with Children<\/span><\/i><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Alternatives to Traditional Funeral Arrangements<\/span><\/i><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Multi-Purpose Content<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When you create useful blog posts, then you should share them through your social media channels and any other form of outreach like newsletters. When implemented effectively, your content will simultaneously humanize your business while demonstrating your expertise.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Monthly Newsletter<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Similar to doctors, teachers, and police officers, funeral directors are a vital part of their communities. If you aren\u2019t already leveraging this, you should start sending out a monthly newsletter with valuable information for the community, whether or not they currently need your services.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When disseminated through print or email, a regular newsletter can do wonders when it comes to keeping your brand at the top of people\u2019s minds. This can be especially useful when it comes to <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.johnsonconsulting.com\/increase-your-preneed-sales-with-these-7-tips\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">increasing preneed sales<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. It can also help engage your community, allowing them to stay abreast of any updates to your services.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Upcoming events, featured columns from team members, and memoriam sections for those who\u2019ve used your services can all be great additions to your newsletter. Additionally, you could consider including more lighthearted moments, such as an advice column from the funeral director\u2019s desk.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Be sure to always include your contact information in the newsletter. Similar to social media, your newsletter provides another way for people to connect with your funeral home, making them more likely to choose you when they need it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Testimonials and Reviews<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In addition to a blog\u2013\u2013which effectively serves as the funeral home\u2019s words\u2013\u2013you\u2019ll also want to include a section with voices of the community. An effective way to do so is by incorporating family testimonials and reviews on your website. When a visitor sees real, satisfied accounts of your services written by community members, they\u2019re more likely to trust your team. Almost like a virtual referral, positive reviews hold a convincing power.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Additionally, reviews on social media and Google have a two-fold effect. While positive reviews certainly steer people towards your business, they can also have an impact on your rankings in Google. Both the number of reviews and their average score <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.searchenginepeople.com\/blog\/just-how-much-do-google-reviews-impact-your-seo-ranking.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">correlate heavily<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> with a business\u2019s position in Google searches.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If your business has yet to receive sufficient Google reviews, then you should consider tactfully soliciting such feedback from families. One way to do so is through <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.johnsonconsulting.com\/services\/performance-tracker\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Performance Tracker<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. This tool can help you solicit Google reviews and survey responses from your families, allowing you to gain valuable insight into where your business excels and stands to grow.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Funeral Marketing Ideas from Experts<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Successful marketing for a funeral home is no easy feat. Similar to medical services, death care occupies an emotional space, one that makes people resistant to in-your-face advertisements or shoddy discounts. Even blogs, social media, and newsletters\u2013\u2013seemingly simple outlets\u2013\u2013can make you appear unprofessional when handled improperly. That\u2019s why it\u2019s always a good idea to seek the help of death care professionals.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Comprised of funeral home owners, directors, and managers, the consulting team at <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.johnsonconsulting.com\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Johnson Consulting Group<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> understands all aspects of the death care profession.
