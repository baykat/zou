George Voinovich of Ohio and Sen. George LeMieux of Florida \u2014 joining Democrats in support of the legislation. Until this week, Republicans had voted in unison to block the bill from being considered.<\/p>\n<p>The House passed a different version of the legislation in June, but House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said her chamber would quickly approve the Senate version in order to get the bill to President Obama\u2019s desk as soon as possible.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThis is a real step in putting this recession behind us,\u201d said Sen. Mary Landrieu, a Louisiana Democrat, who chairs the Senate Small Business and Entrepreneurship Committee.<\/p>\n<p>Politically, it gives Democrats a much-needed legislative victory on an economic issue before the Nov. 2 congressional elections. Small businesses historically have led the U.S. out of recessions, but they\u2019ve been slow to hire more workers this time around. One reason may be problems accessing credit \u2014 a recent survey by the\u00a0<a title=\"https:\/\/profiles.portfolio.com\/company\/us\/wi\/milwaukee\/national_small_business_association\/1657174\/\" href=\"https:\/\/profiles.portfolio.com\/company\/us\/wi\/milwaukee\/national_small_business_association\/1657174\/\" target=\"_blank\">National Small Business Association<\/a> found that 41 percent of small-business owners haven\u2019t been able to obtain adequate financing.<\/p>\n<p>The Small Business Jobs Act would help small businesses get more loans by providing up to $30 billion in cheap capital to community banks for use in making small-business loans. It also would provide $1.5 billion to state-run small-business credit programs.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThis is a pivotal step toward aiding Main Street America\u2019s economic recovery,\u201d said Jim MacPhee, CEO of\u00a0<a title=\"https:\/\/profiles.portfolio.com\/company\/us\/mi\/schoolcraft\/kalamazoo_county_state_bank\/2681885\/\" href=\"https:\/\/profiles.portfolio.com\/company\/us\/mi\/schoolcraft\/kalamazoo_county_state_bank\/2681885\/\" target=\"_blank\">Kalamazoo County State Bank<\/a> in Schoolcraft, Mich., and chairman of the\u00a0<a title=\"https:\/\/profiles.portfolio.com\/company\/us\/dc\/washington\/independent_community_bankers_of_america\/2558334\/\" href=\"https:\/\/profiles.portfolio.com\/company\/us\/dc\/washington\/independent_community_bankers_of_america\/2558334\/\" target=\"_blank\">Independent Community Bankers of America<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>ICBA estimates community banks will leverage the $30 billion in capital from the federal government into $300 billion of new loans to small businesses.<\/p>\n<p>The legislation also would boost\u00a0<a title=\"https:\/\/southflorida.bizjournals.com\/southflorida\/related_content.html?topic=US%20Small%20Business%20Administration\" href=\"https:\/\/southflorida.bizjournals.com\/southflorida\/related_content.html?topic=US%20Small%20Business%20Administration\" target=\"_blank\">U.S. Small Business Administration<\/a> loan programs by increasing the government guarantee on the SBA\u2019s flagship 7(a) loans to 90 percent and eliminating borrower fees on 7(a) loans and 504 loans, which primarily are used for real estate. These breaks, first instituted as part of the economic stimulus bill, revived SBA lending because they made the loans less risky for lenders and more affordable for borrowers.<\/p>\n<p>The higher guarantee and fee waivers expired at the end of May, however, and SBA lending has fallen dramatically since then. The bill would renew these breaks through Dec. 31.<\/p>\n<p>The bill also would increase the size limits on SBA loans, making them more useful for larger small businesses. The maximum size for 7(a) loans, for example, would be $5 million, instead of the current $2 million.<\/p>\n<p>The legislation provides temporary tax incentives for businesses to invest in new equipment, allowing businesses of all sizes to write off 50 percent of the cost of new equipment immediately, instead of depreciating it over time. Small businesses would be able to expense up to $500,000 of capital expenditures, double the current limit under Section 179 of the tax code.<\/p>\n<p>Most small-business groups supported the legislation, but the\u00a0<a title=\"https:\/\/profiles.portfolio.com\/company\/us\/tn\/nashville\/national_federation_of_independent_business\/2000290\/\" href=\"https:\/\/profiles.portfolio.com\/company\/us\/tn\/nashville\/national_federation_of_independent_business\/2000290\/\" target=\"_blank\">National Federation of Independent Business<\/a> said the bill will provide only limited help.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWhile the bill passed today will help some small businesses that either qualify for the specified tax breaks or qualify for new loans, it falls short of addressing the most significant problems facing all small-business owners \u2014 lack of sales and uncertainty,\u201d said NFIB Senior Vice President Susan Eckerly.<\/p>\n<p>Republicans had blocked the bill because they were denied the ability to offer the amendments they wanted. Many also opposed the $30 billion lending fund for community banks, contending it was just another version of the Troubled Asset Relief Program.<\/p>\n<p>Voinovich said he remained \u201cdisappointed that my colleagues were unable to offer amendments to this bill,\u201d but he \u201cfelt we could no longer wait to pass this legislation. We needed to do something now to help the economy get going.\u201d<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>SBA 7a loans will increase from a maximum of $2 million to 5 million.
