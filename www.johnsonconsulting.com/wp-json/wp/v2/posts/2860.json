I have faith that wherever my path leads, I will always be able to find the funeral service profession personally fulfilling.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Lauren Nelson, of Hancock, Minn., is a fourth-year student at the University of Minnesota in its Program of Mortuary Science. Nelson has planned on a career in the funeral service profession since high school, after several positive experiences with her hometown funeral director. \u201cI feel like it is such a great responsibility to be taking care of someone\u2019s loved one,\u201d said Nelson. \u201cAnd I have held several jobs that have helped prepare me for what I believe I have been called to do.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Both Nelson and Jacobson were chosen from a field of several dozen applicants because of their commitment to the funeral service profession and deep interest in pioneering new ways to assist families with the memorialization of a loved one.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cScholarships are an important recruiting tool to attract and support the best and brightest talent in our field,\u201d said Kathy Wisnefski, executive director of the Funeral Service Foundation. \u201cThe Foundation is honored to award the first of many Memorial Golf Classic Scholarships to two deserving women who undoubtedly are committed to making a difference in the profession and in the lives of those they will serve.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWe are thrilled the Funeral Service Foundation has awarded the Memorial Classic Golf Tournament Scholarships to students who show an unwavering dedication to the profession in the same manner that this year\u2019s honorees, Dave Hirt, Bill Bischoff and Joe Weatherford did before them,\u201d said Jake Johnson, Memorial Classic Golf Tournament Representative and Foundation Trustee. \u201cWe look forward to working with the Foundation to continue to honor those who have blazed a trail in the profession by awarding scholarships to students of funeral service who are sure to do the same in the years to come.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>FSF currently supports five scholarship programs; four available to current students pursuing a career in the profession, and one geared at providing professional development opportunities for women in funeral service.<\/p>\n<p>Along with providing scholarships, the Foundation proactively explores relevant and innovative funding opportunities that will enhance the deathcare profession, benefit funeral directors and allied professionals, thus making a timely impact on local communities.<\/p>\n<p><strong>About the Scholarship:<\/strong><br \/>\nThe Memorial Classic Golf Tournament Scholarships, established in 2010 by the Board of Trustees of the Funeral Service Foundation, was created to honor those who have blazed a trail in the profession. This year\u2019s scholarships honor the memory of three of the profession\u2019s greats: Dave Hirt, Bill Bischoff and Joe Weatherford.<\/p>\n<p>Each year the Memorial Classic Golf Tournament, hosted by Johnson Consulting Group, raises money to honor the memory of an individual whose contribution to the profession has made a lasting impact.<\/p>\n<p>Memorial Classic Golf Tournament Scholarships will be awarded annually to selected students in a mortuary science program accredited by the American Board of Funeral Service Education (ABFSE).<\/p>\n<p><strong>About Dave Hirt:<\/strong><br \/>\nDave Hirt had a life-long commitment to funeral service.

He was a past board member of the Funeral Service Foundation.<\/p>\n<p><strong>About Bill Bischoff:<\/strong><br \/>\nBill Bischoff was a longtime leader in the profession, serving as Vice President of Sales for Hillenbrand Industries for 20 years, Senior Vice President of Sales and Marketing at Aurora Casket Company for 10 years, and a consultant to Homesteaders Life Insurance Company and Johnson Consulting Group.<\/p>\n<p><strong>About Joe Weatherford:<\/strong><br \/>\nJoe Weatherford\u2019s commitment to the profession spanned nearly six decades.
