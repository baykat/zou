Rather than get caught up in the urgency of day-to-day operations, strategic planning is an opportunity for leadership to focus on the projects that will lead to long-term success.<\/span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That said, it\u2019s not a challenge you can leap into unprepared. If you want your long-term growth plan to succeed, strategic planning is a crucial step of the process. You must establish precise goals, assess your business\u2019s capabilities, and decide on the best path forward. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Having this plan in place can help you better understand what your funeral home is capable of and avoid costly, ineffective initiatives that only serve to stress your team. When setting out to craft a strategic plan for the upcoming years, here\u2019s what you should consider.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2><\/h2>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Define Success<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When strategizing key company initiatives in your funeral home, start by defining the end goal. By beginning with the end in mind, it\u2019s easier to plan ahead and effectively allocate the resources required.<\/span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Are you looking to grow your funeral home business profits? Do you struggle with staff turnover and want to create a better culture to <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.johnsonconsulting.com\/how-to-recruit-and-retain-top-talent-for-your-funeral-business\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">attract and retain talent<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">? Or perhaps you\u2019re interested in <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.johnsonconsulting.com\/the-funeral-business-lifecycle-exit-phase\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">exit planning<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and want to get the business in a good place before selling it.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2><\/h2>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Evaluate the Prior Year\u00a0<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Once you\u2019ve decided on a company initiative, whether it is introducing new services or optimizing an existing process, the next step is to understand where you are currently and where you\u2019ve been in the past year.<\/span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Take some time to reflect and collect feedback from your team. Explore questions like:\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What went right?<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What went wrong? What did we learn from these failures?<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What are the biggest opportunities in front of us?<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What are the biggest current challenges we face?<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Where do we want the company to be three years from now?<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At Johnson Consulting Group, we send our clients a pre-work questionnaire that includes questions like this and more. The questionnaire is completely anonymous and serves as a crucial starting point as we craft a strategic plan for our clients. By consolidating the answers into a workbook, we can gather insight into a client\u2019s starting position and better advise them going forward.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2><\/h2>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Analyze the Situation and Establish Key Company Outcomes<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Once you have a better understanding of your previous year, it\u2019s time to perform a SWOT analysis. Performing a <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.johnsonconsulting.com\/neglecting-a-swot-analysis-dont-do-it-heres-why\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">SWOT analysis on a regular basis<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is a powerful way to keep track of your funeral home\u2019s health as a business.\u00a0<\/span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">SWOT stands for Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, and Threats. Your funeral home can use a SWOT analysis to assess internal operations and how you stand up to competitors, which helps the leadership team understand where the company is currently positioned.<\/span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">From there, you can decide what outcomes you\u2019d like to see for your funeral home. This could be any number of things, such as improving the family experience, increasing preneed sales, or expanding to a second location.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2><\/h2>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Choose a Key Company Initiative<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Now that you have a foundational understanding of your business\u2019s capabilities, it\u2019s time to choose Key Company Initiatives (KCI). Your team likely has many wonderful ideas, so this is an excellent time to analyze and vet each option before choosing which ones to focus on first.<\/span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This consists of three steps:<\/span><b><\/b><\/p>\n<h3>Development<\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Brainstorm a list of possible KCIs that could achieve the outcome you want. Include everyone during this process, as it will help identify everyone\u2019s perspective.<\/span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When we work with clients, a JCG facilitator will go around the room and gather each person\u2019s thoughts on what is the most important initiative to work on first. Each member of the team will have a unique perspective to offer, which can provide valuable insight during the process.\u00a0<\/span> <b><\/b><\/p>\n<h3>Evaluation<\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After gathering a list of possible initiatives, break down each initiative into more precise components. This will help your team understand how feasible the initiative is as far as budget, current staffing, and other available resources.<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Name of initiative<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> &#8211; Define what the project is and what it will involve.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Owner<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> &#8211; List who will spearhead the initiative. This person does not necessarily have to execute on every step, but they are the main point of contact.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Definition of success<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> &#8211; What is the goal? Establish what your team hopes to achieve as a result of the new initiative.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Milestones and timeline<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> &#8211; Look ahead at your end goal, then break down the smaller steps necessary to get there.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Key performance indicators (KPIs) and metrics<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> &#8211; Discuss how you will measure the success of the initiative using specific KPIs. You should gather metrics before, during, and after launching the initiative.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Resources and support <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&#8211; Compile a list of resources your team can go to for more information. This might include consultants, market data, competitive research, and more.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As the funeral home manager or director, it will be your job to divvy up ownership and individual tasks according to your team\u2019s strengths and availability. If we take the example of increasing preneed sales, you might want to appoint a lead sales agent for the initiative who can administer the training and report back to you on progress.<\/span><b><\/b><\/p>\n<h3>Prioritization<\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Once you\u2019ve finished establishing the components for each KCI, it\u2019s time to narrow down your list and decide which initiative to tackle first.<\/span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For example, remodeling your funeral home facilities might be a KCI you have in mind to improve the customer experience. However, if you lack the cash flow to comfortably budget for the project, you might decide it will take a lower priority on your list.\u00a0<\/span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Where initiatives typically fail is when decision-makers don&#8217;t have all the necessary perspectives required to achieve the proper timeline or result. If your team rushes through the development, evaluation, and prioritization of a KCI, your team may struggle to achieve the desired outcome and waste budget and energy in the process.<\/span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For example, the funeral home owner may prioritize their own ideas rather than take the time to gather the insight and perspective of their team. They might not understand how much time is wasted while waiting for outdated software or a slow network to load. This could directly clash with a KCI to improve the customer experience by adding an online chat to the website.\u00a0<\/span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This is where an outside facilitator, such as the experts at JCG, can be extremely helpful. We can offer funeral directors a fresh, unbiased perspective of the business and a strategic path forward.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2><\/h2>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Monitor the Progress<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As you proceed through the steps of your plan, be ready and available to address issues that come up. In many cases, it will become necessary to adjust the budget. You should be prepared to do so, provided your point person has a thorough justification for said moves.\u00a0<\/span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You should also not be afraid to delegate or reassign work as needed. As frequently as possible, keep in touch with your leadership team to communicate any progress and setbacks.\u00a0<\/span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Accountability is a crucial part of the process, too. Management should regularly check in with the initiative owner, and the initiative owner should check in with any staff they are managing during the rollout. Estimates for budget and timeline are just that \u2014 estimates \u2014 so it\u2019s likely they will differ from the final result. Accountability meetings can help leadership evaluate whether the initiative is on track and make adjustments as needed.<\/span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Generally, it\u2019s best to hold this accountability meeting every 90 days. During the review, recognize successes and wins of the initiative as well as any challenges or concerns. This is also a good time to check if employees are hitting any barriers that are holding them back from success.\u00a0<\/span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">During our strategic plan accountability meetings with clients, we also ask the questions: What went right? What went wrong? What did we learn?<\/span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Questions like these will help you determine how to work more effectively. While each of your initiatives will differ in nature and scope, your business can continually improve the way you plan for and approach new initiatives.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2><\/h2>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Partner with an Expert<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With thorough and strategic allocation of resources, your funeral home can accomplish goals both in the near- and long-term.
