Through accurate and timely financial reporting, you can not only ensure that you\u2019re ready for tax season, but you\u2019ll also be able to create strategic initiatives for years to come.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Tidy bookkeeping requires time and attention to detail, which is why many funeral homes choose to trust a <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.johnsonconsulting.com\/services\/accounting-financial-management\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">funeral home accounting firm like Johnson Consulting Group<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to manage the details on their behalf. Here are some actionable strategies and best practices to help you build and refine your funeral home\u2019s financial management.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">1. Be Timely<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A fundamental component of funeral home accounting is timeliness. The sooner you start your reporting, the sooner you can start building your backlog of financial data. From this data, you can then begin to recognize patterns in revenue and expenditures.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When you have the most up-to-date financial information at your fingertips, you can make more informed decisions. For example, if you hope to make a large purchase\u2013\u2013an expansion, perhaps\u2013\u2013it\u2019s essential to know exactly where your business stands financially and <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.johnsonconsulting.com\/the-dos-and-donts-of-budgeting-and-strategic-pricing-initiatives\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">whether or not you have the necessary budget<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Timeliness will also help you cut down on errors and omissions. If you wait to document certain financial transactions, then you\u2019ll be more likely to forget specific circumstances and details when you move to document them.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you have a small team that already wears many hats, timeliness may be a challenge. In order to keep your bookkeeping records on track, it may make sense to <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.johnsonconsulting.com\/investing-in-funeral-home-accounting-services\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">invest in an accounting firm<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> that specializes in deathcare to take the task off your hands.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">2. Maintain Accurate Deposit Records<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In addition to logging all transactions in a timely manner, it is essential for funeral homes to maintain accurate deposit records. You\u2019ll want to get into the habit of preparing a deposit immediately after a transaction is made and ensure these deposits are properly documented.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Doing so means accounting for every dollar of incoming revenue, where it&#8217;s from, and what it was for.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This is especially important for funeral businesses that work with cash transactions, as it eliminates the chance of misplacing or forgetting to enter a cash transaction. Properly tracking your revenue sources in this manner will also help protect your funeral home from fraud.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">3. Categorize Expenses Consistently<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Categorizing expenses correctly is a necessity. When it comes to expenses, take the time to properly document, track, and categorize every transaction. If you haven\u2019t already developed a clear category structure for your expenses (chart of accounts), then you\u2019ll want to do so immediately. Include instructions for your team that help them to distinguish between similar categories.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This includes tracking all deposits, purchases for goods and services, fees, and any other associated costs. Regularly reviewing your transactions can also help prevent surprises when tax season rolls around.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">4. Don\u2019t Overuse the \u201cMiscellaneous\u201d Category<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A common mistake made by many funeral homes is over-utilizing the \u201cmiscellaneous\u201d category. While \u201cmiscellaneous\u201d can be a helpful utility, depending on it too much can lead to inaccurate bookkeeping and tax filing processes. If you\u2019re labeling everything as miscellaneous, then you\u2019re creating financial opacity for yourself down the road, making it more difficult to analyze your expenditures, not to mention capitalize on tax deductions.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Instead, you\u2019ll want to create precise and detailed categories for each type of expenses so that you can properly track them. This also eliminates the need to try and guess the details of a specific purchase or transaction if the receipt is lost or otherwise unavailable.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">5. Link your POS and Accounting Software<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In order to maintain a comprehensive and updated view of your records, it is important to link yourcase management system and accounting software. This way, you can minimize latency between your financial tracking and reporting, saving time and reducing the risk of errors from manual data entry. However, your ability to do this may depend on the technical limitations of your <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.johnsonconsulting.com\/purchasing-funeral-home-accounting-software\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">funeral home accounting software<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">6. Reconcile Receivables\u00a0<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Finally, to properly manage your cash flow, it is essential to ensure that all receivables are reconciled. This means that any incoming payments are properly accounted for and recorded in the appropriate place.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Doing so allows for easy tracking of all receivables and allows your management team to better identify and avoid potential collection issues.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Funeral Home Accounting Support with JCG<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While generalized accountants are plentiful in every region of the country, only an <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.johnsonconsulting.com\/funeral-home-financials-hiring-the-right-accounting-firm\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">accountant with a specialization in the death care industry<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> can help you utilize the best practices of the field.
