While industry trends can cause a funeral home\u2019s revenue to grow or shrink within any given year, truly well-managed businesses will succeed in the long run, even for generations, regardless of the greater market climate.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here are the <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">dos<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">don\u2019ts<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> of budgetary planning.<br \/>\n<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">1. DO plan for change every year.\u00a0<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If the 2020 pandemic taught us anything in death care, it\u2019s that funeral businesses need to be adaptive. When in-person gatherings were no longer viable, funeral homes had to pivot to virtual ceremonies and other alternative means of honoring the deceased. With the market impacted so drastically, a funeral home\u2019s plan for 2019 simply wouldn\u2019t have worked for 2020 or 2021.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Additionally, trends and preferences continue to change over time. The growing preference for cremations over traditional burials, for example, is a long-term trend that funeral homes can\u2019t ignore. Account for this in your budget plan every year and be on the lookout for other shifts in the profession.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In short, even industries as traditional as death care are subject to frequent changes and trends. The best funeral businesses will anticipate and react to these trends, then budget accordingly.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">2. DO research.\u00a0<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As well as researching the plethora of market share trends among your competition, your team should conduct research in a variety of areas. Your accounting team should look into your business\u2019s financial performance, perform regular <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.johnsonconsulting.com\/services\/valuation-services\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">funeral home valuations<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, and report them to your management team.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You\u2019ll also want to consider any additional economic circumstances, such as inflation, interest rates, and taxes. For example, be sure to monitor pricing and labor costs when inflation is high.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">3. DO divide your planning into short-term and long-term.<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As you create plans for your funeral home, you\u2019ll need both short- and long-term goals.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Your short-term plans will involve your goals for the immediate future in the 1-2 year range. These plans tend to be smaller steps and may consist of hiring new team members, reaching a benchmark of preneed sales, or renovating portions of your facilities \u2013 in other words, bite-size action steps that contribute toward a long-term key company initiative.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A long-term plan will explore more impactful company goals you hope to achieve in five years or more. These might include acquiring additional funeral or cremation businesses, starting a new business segment, or achieving a certain level of market share. Larger company initiatives like these will likely need to be allocated a chunk of the budget over time.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In most cases, it\u2019s best to work from the top down. Determine your most important key company initiatives first, then break it down into smaller steps you must take to achieve it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">4. DO conduct a SWOT Analysis.<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One of the biggest mistakes we see among funeral directors is neglecting to conduct a <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.johnsonconsulting.com\/neglecting-a-swot-analysis-dont-do-it-heres-why\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00a0SWOT analysis<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. When thoroughly conducted annually, a SWOT analysis provides you with a thorough conception of where your business stands, allowing you to plan appropriately.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A SWOT analysis consists of four key components:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li aria-level=\"1\"><b>Strengths: <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This consists of any areas in which your business currently excels. Ample sales of preneed services could be considered a strength.\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<ul>\n<li aria-level=\"1\"><b>Weaknesses: <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Weaknesses are any areas of your business that stand to grow or improve. For example, low customer satisfaction reviews might be a weakness.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<ul>\n<li aria-level=\"1\"><b>Opportunities: <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Any outside factors that could present a boon to your business would fall into the category of opportunities. For example, a growing interest in cremation services presents the opportunity to capitalize on this market share.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<ul>\n<li aria-level=\"1\"><b>Threats: <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Threats refer to any factors that could potentially harm your business. For example, new competition and <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.funeralresultsmarketing.com\/cremation-arrangement-websites\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">online value cremation businesses<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">5. DO consider all facets of your operation.<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As the saying goes, a chain is only as strong as its weakest link, and in many cases, it\u2019s helpful to view businesses in the same manner. In order to ensure that your funeral home is operating at an optimal level, you\u2019ll have to consider each of its aspects as it relates to the others.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Your service levels, strategic pricing initiatives, merchandising, competition, market share, preneed sales, demographics, team members, and financials all work together to create the picture of your funeral business. By examining each aspect of your business holistically, you can begin figuring out how to plan accordingly.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">6. DON\u2019T set and forget.\u00a0<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At the end of every month, take a close look at your budget and financial performance. This includes not only reviewing profit and loss statements but also examining balance sheets, cash flow statements, accounts payable, and accounts receivable.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If possible, you\u2019ll also want to conduct a more formal review every few months with an accountant. While anyone can tell you if your business is currently profitable, only a skilled accountant can help devise strategies to more prudently manage your finances.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">7. DON\u2019T put it off.<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The most efficiently managed companies are guided by both short- and long-term goals. The key to any business initiative is the proper availability of funds, making it imperative for funeral home owners and directors to place budgeting at the center of their business strategy.
