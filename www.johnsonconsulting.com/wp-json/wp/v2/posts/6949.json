During this time, many older employees sought early retirements, while younger workers\u2013\u2013bolstered by government stimulus dollars\u2013\u2013became more selective about where they worked, how they worked, and who they worked for.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Funeral homes face a particular set of challenges with regard to <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.johnsonconsulting.com\/5-ways-to-keep-quality-talent-in-your-funeral-home\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">retaining workers<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. The in-person nature of funeral services led many to fear exposure to COVID-19, and many part-time employees sought work elsewhere. All of these factors come in tandem with a profession that is rapidly changing.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To survive the Great Resignation, funeral homes need to address both the needs of their employees and the shifting trends in death care practices.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Shifting Death Care Trends<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Funeral homes across the nation are experiencing increased volumes of work; however, the availability of personnel with proper licensing isn\u2019t keeping up. On top of this, the death care profession is experiencing unprecedented shifts in family preferences that were further exacerbated by the pandemic.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Most significantly is the growing popularity of cremations. In 2000, American cremation rates were about 26%. By 2021, this number <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.statista.com\/statistics\/251702\/cremation-rate-in-the-united-states\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">more than doubled<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Since cremations cost significantly less than funerals with burials, it\u2019s become essential for funeral homes to figure out not only how to incorporate cremations into their service offerings but also how to pair cremations with additional services.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Beyond cremations, the death care profession is also seeing growth in a variety of other services. Alternative arrangements such as green burials, virtual services, and celebrations of life are increasing in popularity. And while these growing sectors present new opportunities for funeral homes, they also require the proper talent and training.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Engage Your Employees<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To adapt to the changing death care landscape, you\u2019ll need to develop a business strategy that both attracts and retains new talent. This all starts with proper onboarding. Beyond conducting the proper training and introduction to your workplace, your onboarding should also introduce team members to your workplace culture.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Collecting employee feedback is a great way to learn how to best engage your employees. By actively soliciting feedback, you\u2019ll generate valuable insights into your employees\u2019 experiences and what you can do to create a more positive workplace.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One benefit that\u2019s particularly important to younger generations is providing opportunities for growth. That\u2019s why you should consider having regular meetings with each of your team members to help them plan a career path within your business. Over time, each of your employees will acquire new skills on the job, take on additional responsibilities, and contribute more to your funeral home. If employees can see a future at your funeral home, then they\u2019re more likely to stick around.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Conduct a Workflow Analysis<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To figure out how your funeral home can best engage your employees, you might consider <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.johnsonconsulting.com\/7-growth-strategies-funeral-cemetery-business\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">conducting a workflow analysis<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, that is, a review of all processes related to each of your operations. This could include sales, clerical work, training, and recruitment, among others.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The goal of such an analysis is to closely examine how all of your processes get done, eliminate efficiencies, and, if possible, automate certain tasks.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For example, a workflow analysis of a funeral home would likely take a look at its <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.johnsonconsulting.com\/preneed-funeral-sales\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">preneed sales funnel<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Assuming the program is currently working well, a workflow analysis might help you determine how to make the process even more efficient, like adding a marketing strategy.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Alternatively, a workflow analysis may take a closer look at employee onboarding and retention. Through extensive observation, the analysis may find that higher turnover rates are the result of subpar benefits and employees feeling overstretched in their responsibilities. From these findings, your leadership can begin to implement changes.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Doing It Right<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With the profession rapidly changing, today\u2019s funeral home\u2019s face a litany of barriers to success. Finding employees with the proper certification, training people in new death care techniques, and adapting to the shifting preferences of families\u2013\u2013all while continuing to oversee the day-to-day processes of their funeral homes. When properly conducted, a workflow analysis can take months\u2013not including the time it takes to develop and implement changes. This is where it can be helpful to rely on the expertise of consultants.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.johnsonconsulting.com\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Johnson Consulting Group<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, our team of death care consultants has worked in the business for decades.
