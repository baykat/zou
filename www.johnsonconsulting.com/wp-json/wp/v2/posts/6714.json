When implemented properly, accounting processes can become a cornerstone of a funeral home\u2019s business strategy, providing the quantitative clarity to spur continued growth.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In many cases, funeral professionals turn to accounting software, and while these solutions are a great place to start more effectively recording payments and monitoring expenses, they can\u2019t offer you the expertise of an in-person accountant, one who can help you make sense of your finances and advise accordingly. More importantly, no software can provide you with the best practices for death care industry accounting and financial management.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.johnsonconsulting.com\/services\/accounting-financial-management\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Johnson Consulting Group<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, our Accounting and Financial Management Team specializes in the unique needs of the funeral business. Armed with industry-specific knowledge, one of our accountants can help you get a clearer picture of your funeral home\u2019s financial health and help you create strategic initiatives to meet your goals.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What the JCG Accounting Department is Working On<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With any client, JCG Accounting Managers and Controllers will prepare financial reports, ensure IRS compliance, and evaluate the financial operations of your funeral business. Beyond these standard processes, however, JCG has structured our team in a way that provides deeper analytics, allowing you to not only understand where your funeral home currently stands but also drive future success.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As the JCG Accounting and Financial Management Team\u00a0 work to implement budgeting processes for clients, we\u2019ll conduct a thorough budget to actual variance analysis, utilizing past years\u2019 information to forecast both threats and opportunities in the future. This analysis will take a holistic examination of both your funeral home\u2019s performance and industry trends and will allow you to make strategic decisions that account for seasonality and other trends in death care.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A Focus on Valuations<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Central to JCG\u2019s accounting methodology are our <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.johnsonconsulting.com\/consistent-funeral-home-valuation-important\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">valuation services<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Whether you\u2019re looking to expand your business, prepare for a sale, or more thoroughly understand your market position, a valuation provides an integral baseline for strategic planning.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If your funeral home has recently acquired additional businesses, your business might be worth more than the sum of its parts. For example, acquiring another local funeral home likely cuts down on your competition, disproportionately increasing your valuation.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In line with valuation, our team will also utilize accounting and expense management analyses to understand what your enterprise is worth as a whole. If any variables are hurting your valuation, we\u2019ll be able to provide the insight needed to address these issues.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Accounting FAQs<\/span><\/h2>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How quickly can I get my financials?<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If your funeral business has gone for months without <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.johnsonconsulting.com\/4-pillars-of-success\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">financial reporting<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, we can immediately help you get back on track. While certain processes (valuations, for example) take a bit more time to complete, we can quickly help you monitor revenue, expenses, payroll, taxes, and balance sheets.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What are JCG clients the most grateful for?<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Our clients always appreciate the depth and scope of financial data we provide. For both emerging and established funeral businesses, we can obtain and track a breadth of financial metrics that provide a clear picture of your funeral home\u2019s performance.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Does JCG work with QuickBooks desktop?<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If your business currently works with the desktop version of QuickBooks, we can help you migrate your financials to the online software. By going online, you\u2019ll be able to collaborate more effectively with our teams.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Understanding the Value of Funeral Home Accountants<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While a traditional accountant can help you nail down the basics, only a team with funeral industry experience can properly advise you beyond the numbers. Naturally, the JCG team will help you drill down the data, but we also provide strategic guidance that allows you to project into the future. To accomplish this, we call on our team of death care experts. In addition to understanding the financial intricacies of running a business, we also understand how your business fits into the greater marketplace.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Free Consultations<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To better understand how your funeral home can work with JCG\u2019s Accounting and Financial Management Team , we will provide a free consultation, during which time we\u2019ll review your financials and begin to offer guidance. And with tax season over, summer is the ideal time to explore a new accounting partnership.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At the end of the day, anybody can close your books, but few can offer the level of death care expertise as JCG. Our team shares a collective 600 years of experience in the funeral business, giving us the ability to not only meet your current needs but rise to the challenges of the death care industry.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<a href='https:\/\/www.johnsonconsulting.com\/services\/accounting-financial-management\/' class='small-button smallblue'>GET ACCOUNTING RIGHT<\/a>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Every funeral director understands the importance of tracking their money, and many take on accounting duties themselves; however, there is much more to accounting than tracking revenue and expenses in preparation for tax season.
