The event will uncover a systematic sales process of effective selling: prospecting, appointment setting, effective pre-need presentations, protection security among families, as well as unique referrals. It will also focus on the sales manager role, covering their sales management plan, best leadership practices, motivating your team and getting the most out of your sales program.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>\u201cAn effective and impactful pre-need sales program is not simply hiring someone, teaching them to fill out a contract, have them sit in your lobby, and write up the families that walk-in and asked to buy,\u201d says Gary O\u2019Sullivan, CCFE. \u201cThe goal of pre-need is to engage with the marketplace by talking to families who are the \u201cundecided\u201d and in the process helping them see the value of before need planning, getting them protected now, and in doing so, you are securing your future businesses today. Selling is a proactive, not reactive; it\u2019s based on a proven process, not simply a pleasing personality, and build on the fundamental belief that the more you serve, the more you sell.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Both The Gary O\u2019Sullivan Company and JCG believe that to accomplish this companies, need a proven selling method that is teachable, measurable, and executable. Director of Business Development, Lori Salberg says our core values and passion to serve others, this is without question, a perfect partnership.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWe are very excited to partner with Gary O\u2019Sullivan on this event. He is an industry legend in pre-need sales and training,\u201d says Lori Salberg. \u201cHe truly understands the unique ministerial aspect of Catholic cemetery pre-planning. Anyone working in pre-need sales (new, veteran, or in a managerial role), will benefit from time spent with Gary.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI have known and admired JCG throughout the years. They are a proven organization that focuses on aiding organizations to become and remain a healthy and viable business, using their innovating methodologies, which is something few consulting firms can do,\u201d says O\u2019Sullivan. \u201cHowever, that is just part of why I respect JCG; it\u2019s also because of the company\u2019s character and focuses on not only processes but people as much or more. I view it as a privilege to work with the JCG on this event. It\u2019s as exciting as it is humbling to partner on specific events with such a respected brand.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>The event will take place on March 17th at the Diocese of Orange in Garden Grove, CA.
