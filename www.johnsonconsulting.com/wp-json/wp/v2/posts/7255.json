However, according to Gallup\u2019s <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">State of the Global Workplace <\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">report, 85% of employees are either <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.gallup.com\/workplace\/231668\/dismal-employee-engagement-sign-global-mismanagement.aspx\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">not engaged or actively disengaged<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> with their work.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While there are a variety of ways to engage the staff of your funeral home \u2014 incentive compensation, robust benefits, and growth opportunities, to name a few \u2014 no two team members desire the exact same things. To better understand how to <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.johnsonconsulting.com\/employee-engagement\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">engage your teams<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, leadership must regularly meet with their staff.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">By creating a schedule of informal check-ins combined with more thorough quarterly and annual assessments, managers can better understand their employees and how to engage them most effectively.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One-on-one Meetings<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Funeral home leadership should set aside time for casual, one-on-one meetings with each of their team members. Occurring on either a weekly or bi-weekly basis, these meetings offer managers the chance to check in with their team members on both the personal and professional levels.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Unlike more formal review-based meetings, weekly one-on-one sessions allow team members to express how they\u2019re doing, what\u2019s currently going well, and what they might be struggling with. This information is valuable for leaders as it can alert them to potentially larger issues before they affect the business.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It\u2019s important to note that this one-on-one shouldn\u2019t feel like a laundry list of tasks for the employee to complete. Rather, it\u2019s a time to check in and address any issues that might be holding them back in the short and long term.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Quarterly Check-in<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While similar to weekly one-on-one meetings, quarterly check-ins require a bit more preparation, and they should be primarily focused on team member goals and their progress. To start off, managers should ask about each goal of the team member. These goals may be related to numbers, or they might consist of personal development. Regardless, managers should use this time to get up to speed on each team member\u2019s status.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Once updated, managers can then dig deeper and figure out what\u2019s going well for the employee and what challenges are holding them back. This allows managers to adjust goals effectively and offer assistance as needed.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Annual Review<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The most formal variety of meetings, <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.johnsonconsulting.com\/annual-reviews-the-ultimate-staff-evaluation-checklist\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">annual reviews<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> should begin with written evaluations of the employee, both from the employee themself and from their direct manager. Once this information has been collected, both team members can use it as a jumping-off point for discussion, running through each goal, success, and challenge of the team member over the last year.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">During the performance review, managers should remind employees that these sessions are two-way conversations. If a manager notes that an employee struggled with a component of their role, an employer should feel comfortable to honestly express what contributed to this struggle. This way, both personnel can discuss the ways in which these issues can be addressed in the coming year.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Overall, annual reviews should be future-focused. Through the process of retrospectively reviewing a team member\u2019s performance, managers should help them build new goals for the coming year, goals that both challenge their strengths and encourage them to grow in areas of struggle.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Develop Your Team with JCG<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Regular meetings help you stay in touch with employee strengths, needs, and struggles. By using these meetings to inform your managerial practice, you can improve engagement and retention in the long run. While much can be done to engage employees by increasing pay and providing on-the-job training, in many cases, team members can benefit from outside learning.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Top-performing employees are often rewarded with increased responsibilities and pay. To make sure these growing employees have the skills they need to do the job right, you can look to the help of outside funeral home training courses.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Offered through Johnson Consulting Group, a leading funeral home consulting firm, <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.johnsonconsulting.com\/services\/jcg-academy\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">JCG Academy<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> helps equip death care professionals with industry-leading tactics.
