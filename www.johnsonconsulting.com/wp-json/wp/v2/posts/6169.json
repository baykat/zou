The funeral industry, once dominated by legacy businesses, is changing in unprecedented ways. A <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/nfda.org\/news\/statistics\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">rise in cremations<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, shift to green burials, and a growing preference for personalized memorial services have contributed to exciting shake-ups in the death care profession.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That said, it takes more than enthusiasm to get your funeral home up and running successfully. In addition to the basic procedures that come with starting any type of business, you\u2019ll also want to consider the particularities of the death care profession.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Create a Business Plan<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Unless you happen to have hundreds of thousands in the bank, starting your business will require some loans, and for most lenders, you\u2019ll need to supply a business plan. To draft your business plan, you\u2019ll to do the following:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Outline your business, where it will operate, and the services it will provide<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Identify who will manage the funeral home<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Identify who will be the customer base of your business<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Explain your goals in terms of revenue<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Itemize your anticipated expenses, both startup and operating costs<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Form a Business Entity<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To start any kind of business\u2013\u2013funeral or otherwise\u2013\u2013you\u2019ll need to form a legal entity. This protects you from being held personally liable in the event of business debts. For funeral homes, the four main types of business entities are:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li aria-level=\"1\"><b>Sole proprietorship: <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This structure does not legally separate a business from its owner. While this entitles one to 100% of a business\u2019s profit, it also leaves you liable for any debts or lawsuits.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<ul>\n<li aria-level=\"1\"><b>Partnership: <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Like a sole proprietorship, a partnership leaves you liable for any business debts; however, more than one individual shares this type of business.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<ul>\n<li aria-level=\"1\"><b>Limited liability company (LLC): <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Able to be owned by one or more people, an LLC is ideal for funeral home owners as they shield your personal assets from taxation and liability.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<ul>\n<li aria-level=\"1\"><b>Corporation: <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A corporation is a legal entity owned by shareholders and run by a board of directors. For a funeral business that\u2019s just starting out, a corporation likely isn\u2019t an option.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Name Your Business<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When you form your business entity, you\u2019ll need to provide a name. While restaurants and Silicon Valley startups benefit from clever, quippy names, with funeral businesses, it\u2019s best to keep it simple. Think of something classic\u2013\u2013possibly your last name\u2013\u2013that will last for generations. Also, make sure there are no nearby competitors with something similar.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Apply for Business Licenses and Permits<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Funeral homes don\u2019t require a specific license; however, embalmers and funeral directors do. Many states also have regulations regarding preneed services, so check with your local agencies to be sure you\u2019re updated on these policies. You\u2019ll also need to contact OSHA to ensure your facilities are up to code.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Additionally, you\u2019ll want to consider general business registrations required by local, state, and federal governments. You\u2019ll likely need a sales tax permit, <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.irs.gov\/businesses\/small-businesses-self-employed\/apply-for-an-employer-identification-number-ein-online\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Employer Identification Number<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, and an occupancy permit.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Secure Funding<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Even small funeral homes come with startup costs well over $100,000. Luckily, there are several different options to fund your small business venture. Before applying for them, get your business plan, permits, and taxes in order. This will make it easier to discuss funding with investors or banks.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Banks, local or national, are a great place to start, as their response can help you identify the level of funding you\u2019ll qualify for. They can provide term loans, lines of credit, or even SBA loans. For those who don\u2019t qualify for banks\u2019 lending criteria, you can turn to the Small Business Administration (SBA) lenders for those who don\u2019t qualify for banks\u2019 lending criteria. Particularly if you\u2019re just starting your business, <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.sba.gov\/funding-programs\/loans\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">SBA loans<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> can give you favorable rates. While the application process is rigorous, the payoff is worth it.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Open a Bank Account\u00a0<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Especially if you start an LLC, you\u2019ll want to open up a dedicated bank account for your business. Again, this will help protect your personal assets in the event of business losses. Along with a business bank account, you should also open a business credit card, one that\u2019s in the business\u2019s name rather than yours. Even if you initially charge few expenses, building up credit in the name of your business can help you obtain better interest rates and higher lines of credit.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Remember, if you start an LLC, your business takes on an identity separate from your own. And you can\u2019t build up business credit with your personal cards. Having separate credit and banking accounts also makes it easier to perform accounting tasks and files your business\u2019s taxes.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Get Insurance<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To cover potential losses and liability claims, you\u2019ll want to look into insurance for your funeral business. Any funeral home will need several different insurance policies:<\/span><b><\/b><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li aria-level=\"1\"><b>General liability insurance: <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This protects you if a guest gets injured on your property, potentially covering legal fees and other expenses.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<ul>\n<li aria-level=\"1\"><b>Commercial property insurance: <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This policy will cover any insured equipment, facilities, or inventory in the event of damage.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<ul>\n<li aria-level=\"1\"><b>Commercial auto insurance: <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Much like traditional car insurance, these policies will protect any business-owned vehicles and their drivers.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Worker\u2019s compensation insurance:<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> This helps cover costs in the event of an employee getting hurt while on the job or encountering medical expenses.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Create Your Marketing Plan<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Since 2009, the <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/nfda.org\/news\/statistics#:~:text=According%20to%20the%20National%20Directory,2018%3A%2019%2C177\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">number of funeral homes has fallen<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> slowly yet steadily. At the same time, the <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.prb.org\/usdata\/indicator\/deaths\/chart\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">total yearly deaths are stagnant<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, making the funeral industry highly competitive. On top of this, many funeral homes have existed for generations, meaning your competition is likely a local institution. To differentiate your business and stand out, you\u2019ll need a solid marketing plan. You\u2019ll want to consider:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Developing a useful professional website<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Crafting outreach content such as emails and social media<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Offering personalized funeral services<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Creating an SEO strategy<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Managing your online reputation and reviews<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Establishing partnerships with local businesses<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Consider Expert Help<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The key to any new funeral business is awareness marketing. Before anyone books a service with your funeral home, they\u2019ll need to know that your business exists and why they should trust you. In an industry dominated by legacy players, this is not as easy as it sounds. Luckily, there are outlets like <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.johnsonconsulting.com\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Johnson Consulting Group<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> that specialize in the intricacies of funeral home marketing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Their expert consultants can help you through every step of the funeral home process, from conception to marketing.
