By taking the time to analyze your funeral home\u2019s position in the marketplace, you can more effectively plan for the future, making strategic adjustments that set your funeral home on the path to success.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Still, a valuation is just data, albeit a complex and thorough sequence of data.

For many funeral businesses, a declining interest in traditional burials has presented a threat.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A professional, in-depth SWOT analysis can take months to complete; however, by taking the time to brainstorm the SWOT categories with your team, you can quickly identify areas to focus on, whether this means addressing a threat or seizing upon an opportunity.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Make Operational Adjustments<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A valuation is an unbiased, quantitative look at what your funeral home is worth, and the results may be much lower than what you desire. In these cases, a valuation presents the hard truths, allowing you to look at core areas in need of attention. These may include:<\/span><b><\/b><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li aria-level=\"1\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.johnsonconsulting.com\/increase-your-preneed-sales-with-these-7-tips\/\"><b>Preneed sales<\/b><\/a><b>: <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Few strategies will increase the value of your funeral home as much as fleshing out your preneed backlog. By selling pre-arranged services, you\u2019ll not only get some immediate cash flow, but you\u2019ll also ensure continued business in the future.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<ul>\n<li aria-level=\"1\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.johnsonconsulting.com\/remodels-that-wont-break-the-bank\/\"><b>Funeral home aesthetics<\/b><\/a><b>: <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Depending on the scope of the project, renovations can be costly and time-consuming. However, replacing outdated lighting fixtures, carpeting, and finishes can be a budget-friendly way to increase the value of your funeral home and appeal to more families.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<ul>\n<li aria-level=\"1\"><b>Accounting: <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.johnsonconsulting.com\/purchasing-funeral-home-accounting-software\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">dedicated <\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">accounting manager can help you examine expense management across your funeral home.

For example, an exceptionally high valuation, combined with optimal market conditions, might make you consider selling your business earlier than expected. Conversely, a lower valuation may indicate that you\u2019ll need to execute some strategic initiatives before selling.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">No matter how long you plan to own your funeral business, it\u2019s important to remember that you\u2019ll likely have to sell it or pass it on to the next generation. Because of this, from the day you begin operating your business, you\u2019ll want to have an exit strategy, however loosely defined.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As the years go by, annual valuations will serve as a key benchmark of success for your funeral home, allowing you to track your progress in relation to your eventual exit.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Right Direction<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Annual valuations function like a yearly check-up for your funeral home, providing the quantitative data needed to measure the progress toward your business goals\u2013\u2013whether this is to increase value for a sale or pass the business down to a family member. Conducting a valuation, however, is more than simply adding up revenue and assets. To conduct a professional, unbiased evaluation of your funeral home, you\u2019ll need the help of accounting and financial management professionals.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.johnsonconsulting.com\/services\/accounting-financial-management\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Johnson Consulting Group<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, our team of experts has the death care experience and resources to establish exactly how much your business is worth.
