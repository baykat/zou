We were very fortunate that our community not only welcomed us, but also many families placed their trust in us at their time of need.  We are most grateful as our business grew over 200 calls per year.<\/p>\n<p>However, we knew there would come a time when we would want to sell the business since our two daughters and son-in-law had their own careers with no interest in funeral service.  That is where Dave Hirt, a long time friend, and Johnson Consulting Group became involved and helped us through every step of the transition.<\/p>\n<p>Your company was so different from what we had heard about and expected regarding how merger and acquisition companies typically operate. With the help and guidance of Dave listening and understanding our needs, we developed the process we would follow to sell the business.  It started with a complete business valuation, supported with detailed financial analysis, followed by your many recommendations and improvements which added significant value to the worth of our business.  The professional and confidential approach to marketing the business worked perfectly by identifying and screening the qualified buyers that met our criteria.  Priority #1 was to place it in good hands by being certain the new owner shared our values and principles for the business and community.<\/p>\n<p>Faye and I will be forever grateful for the excellent way you and your associates worked with us in meeting our goals.  We would feel proud and privileged to share our experience with other owners considering or facing a business transition.<\/p>\n<p>Ron and Faye Shuler, Shuler Funeral Home, Hendersonville, North Carolina<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Dear Tom: Faye and I just wanted to write a letter thanking the Johnson Consulting Group for helping us transition our business to a new owner allowing us to begin to enjoy our retirement.
