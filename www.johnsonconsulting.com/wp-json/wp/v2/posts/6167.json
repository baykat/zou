As the saying goes: In business, if you\u2019re not growing, you\u2019re dying. While this expression might be a bit overdramatic, increasing your funeral home\u2019s profitability can ensure its longevity and even prepare it to be sold.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Changing times call for adaptive business practices, so we\u2019ve compiled three surefire ways to boost the bottom line of your funeral home.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">1. Provide Cremation Services<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to the National Funeral Directors Association, the <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/nfda.org\/news\/statistics\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">projected burial rate for 2021<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is 36.6%, compared to 57.7% for cremations, and this gap is only expected to widen in the coming years. If you currently offer no cremation services, or you outsource them to a third-party crematorium, then you risk falling victim to these changing preferences.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Incorporating cremation services also leaves the potential to offer other related services. With a growing number of cremations occurring, many funeral homes have begun to embrace ash scattering rituals, wearable remains, and even plantable remains.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Combined Services<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For the more traditional family, you could also offer combined services, consisting of a traditional viewing beforehand followed by the cremation. This method offers you the best of both worlds and is becoming increasingly popular.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">2. Offer Keepsakes<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We\u2019re all familiar with the paper pamphlets offered at funerals, and many of us hold on to them as a way to remember our loved ones. With that said, less ephemeral keepsakes such as jewelry, matchbooks, or seed packets are becoming more common. These items can either be offered individually or given to everyone who attends a service.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Some ideas to consider:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Necklace or bracelet charms<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Memorial wristbands<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Engraved glass hearts<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Forget-me-not seed packets<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Memorial magnets<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Memory coins<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Bookmarks<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When it comes to funeral keepsakes, the possibilities are endless. Just about any tasteful item can be customized, offering attendees a way to remember their loved ones. The key is to offer only a handful of these items. If you offer an entire catalog of funeral merchandise, you risk having your business feel like a beachside gift shop.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Additionally, before you hire an in-house jewelry designer, consider the variety of online outlets offering customized products at surprisingly affordable prices in bulk. Simply order from them and upcharge the price.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">3. Hire Consultants\u00a0<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At first glance, it\u2019s hard to imagine how hiring more people could increase your profit; however, getting personalized guidance from experts in the field can help you see what avenues to take, where you can cut costs, and how to build your business. Many experienced funeral directors become siloed in their practice, only to lose sight of the bigger picture, particularly when it comes to data and shifting trends in the death care profession.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Experts at <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.johnsonconsulting.com\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Johnson Consulting Group<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> offer expertise in a number of areas that allow funeral businesses at any stage to function more effectively and profitably.
