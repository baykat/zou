Much like nurses and police officers, they become pillars of their communities, helping families through tough times in their lives.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, the work of death care\u2013\u2013while rewarding\u2013\u2013is far from easy. Success in funeral homes requires passion, but it also requires some unexpected skills. Here\u2019s what many funeral directors wished they knew before entering this industry.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">1. The Hours<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As with owning any business, directing a funeral home is not a 9-5 job. Most funeral services take place on the weekends, and many stretch late into the evenings. As the director, you\u2019ll likely be needed in these times, even if only in a supporting role.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Additionally, running the funeral business itself is a 24\/7 commitment. While most directors try to stick to bankers\u2019 hours as much as possible, death abides by no time constraints. While you can certainly hire people for on-call shifts, you\u2019ll have to be ready to step in and help coordinate with families who need urgent funeral arrangements.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">2. The Importance of Adapting<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Most funeral homes follow traditional practices such as memorial services, religious (often Christian) rituals, and small ceremonies at the burial grounds. However, it\u2019s important to remember that no tradition is set in stone. Changing times are forcing many funeral directors to rethink the different services they offer and the technology they require. An adaptable funeral home should consider the following:<\/span><b><\/b><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li aria-level=\"1\"><b>Shifts to cremation: <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to the National Funeral Directors Association, the number of <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/nfda.org\/news\/statistics\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">cremations will be more than double<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> that of traditional burials by the year 2030. Because of this, funeral directors should consider your approach to cremation services, not only how you handle the cremation itself but also how you plan rituals around them. Cremations are far less profitable than burials, but you can stress to families the importance of still holding some sort of memorial in tandem with cremation.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<ul>\n<li aria-level=\"1\"><b>Exploring other revenue sources: <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While memorial services will always be the bread and butter of your revenue stream, it never hurts to<a href=\"https:\/\/www.johnsonconsulting.com\/make-your-funeral-business-more-profitable\/\"> explore other options<\/a>. Consider special offerings like customized keepsakes, varied ceremonies, and preneed services that allow for diversified revenue streams.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<ul>\n<li aria-level=\"1\"><b>Incorporate technology: <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Consider using technology to help run your business. For example, the <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.johnsonconsulting.com\/services\/performance-tracker\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Performance Tracker <\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">from Johnson Consulting<\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.johnsonconsulting.com\/services\/performance-tracker\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Group<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> allows you to monitor customer experience and stay abreast of trends in the funeral industry. It enables you to get insight into how families felt about their experience with your funeral home and identify any areas where your team may need to improve.\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">3. The Emotional Impact\u00a0<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When working in the funeral business, you\u2019re often dealing with people experiencing some of the worst moments of their lives. Of course, everyone knows this before entering the death care industry, but not everyone is equipped to handle the emotional impact of constant interaction with those experiencing loss. Many people in the death care industry often report high levels of anxiety and stress, often known as <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.theseniorlist.com\/caregiving\/caregiver-burnout\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">caregiver burnout<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> or fatigue.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This is why it\u2019s important to take care of yourself and your team in addition to your families. If you notice you or your teammates experiencing energy loss, trouble sleeping, irritability, or overall feelings of helplessness, then you\u2019ll want to take action accordingly. Don\u2019t be afraid to take time off, seek counseling, or even join a grief support group to help you mitigate the effects of this fatigue.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">4. Aftercare is Extremely Important<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As a funeral director, it\u2019s important to remember that, while you sell cremations and memorial services, you must offer your families more than these services. When a funeral service is complete, your job is not done. Aftercare services refer to any actions taken to assist families in recovering from the trauma of loss after a memorial or cremation. Not only will aftercare provide healing to families, but it will also establish a relationship with them.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The goal with aftercare is to walk a fine line between compassion and salesmanship. This can be accomplished with a simple email or letter. Naturally, you don\u2019t want to email a family a week after their funeral with a 50% off coupon for their next arrangements. Instead, you can contact them to express your condolences and provide contact information for grief counseling or other related services. By letting a family know you are looking out for their best interests, you\u2019ll cultivate trust in your working relationship.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It\u2019s Okay to Ask For Help<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Entering the death care profession can be a daunting task. Even those who have worked in it for years often feel as though they\u2019ve plateaued or burnt out. You should never be afraid to reach out to other experts in our space\u2013\u2013or even your teammates\u2013\u2013to get new ideas and connect with the community. There is also professional help you can seek.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Johnson Consulting Group specializes in the funeral business.
