Armed with the right information and insights, you can more effectively understand your business\u2019s positioning and plan for the rest of the year.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As we head into the second quarter of 2023, it\u2019s essential to\u2014if you haven\u2019t already\u2014obtain a valuation for your funeral business. If you\u2019re not convinced, here are four reasons why you shouldn\u2019t delay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">1. Understand Your Business Health<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Most planning meetings begin by recapping prior goals and their outcomes. While there are a number of metrics that can indicate the health of your funeral business (profit and loss statements, balance sheets, employee turnover rates), <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.johnsonconsulting.com\/what-goes-into-a-funeral-home-valuation\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">a full-fledged valuation<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> takes everything into account and distills it into a number.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This number provides a top-down overview of how your business is currently performing, and it serves as the benchmark for both the near and long term.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">2. Identify Strengths and Weaknesses<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While a business valuation can be represented as a simple number, a proper valuation also includes all of the constitutive elements that lead to this number. So while your valuation will provide a benchmark of your business\u2019s performance, one that makes it easy to compare to industry competitors, it will also provide you with an in-depth analysis of your business\u2019s strengths and weaknesses.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A professional valuation will not only look at financial reporting, but it will also analyze many other things such as a funeral home\u2019s management, market share, and future earnings prospects. From these more granular observations, your leadership team can determine what\u2019s working and what could work better.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">3. Set Goals for the Year<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Once you\u2019ve thoroughly assessed the current positioning of your business, you can begin <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.johnsonconsulting.com\/strategic-plan\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">creating your strategic plan<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Using your valuation as the jumping-off point, you\u2019ll create a series of objectives that aim to increase the value of your business.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For example, if your business is struggling with high turnover rates, you might create a plan for <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.johnsonconsulting.com\/how-to-recruit-and-retain-top-talent-for-your-funeral-business\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">employee recruitment and retention<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Similarly, if your sales team is struggling to fill your backlog of preneed sales, you may want to review outsourcing that functionality or what programs are being used, such as Lunch and Learns.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ultimately, all of these goals, when executed properly, will lead to a more favorable valuation. In fact, the subsequent valuation can help you evaluate the success of these initiatives.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">4. Plan Your Exit Strategy<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Even if you don\u2019t plan on selling your funeral business in the near future, it\u2019s essential to <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.johnsonconsulting.com\/plan-your-exit-strategy\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">develop an exit strategy<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> as early as you can. Unless you plan on living forever, you\u2019ll eventually need to sell your funeral business \u2014 and a business valuation is a crucial resource during the selling process.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It could take more than a year to make the proper adjustments to get your valuation in an optimal place for sale. Because of this, it\u2019s essential to know your current valuation and how far it may fall short from your goal valuation for a sale.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Planning your succession in the funeral business can be a tricky process that often requires lawyers, brokers, accountants, and other funeral business owners. If you\u2019re looking to learn the ins and outs of exit planning, then you should consider enrolling in the <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.johnsonconsulting.com\/services\/jcg-academy\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">JCG Academy for Leadership and Management<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Understand Your Business\u2019s Worth with JCG<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While a simple valuation can be performed in a matter of minutes using the revenue multiple method, this shorthand valuation neglects the more nuanced components of your business and its cashflow earning potential. When it comes time to sell your business and a professional valuation is required, the resulting number will be different. Because of this, you should seek the help of experts.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.johnsonconsulting.com\/services\/valuation-services\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Johnson Consulting Group provides valuation services<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> that analyze your company\u2019s historical performance and future projections.
