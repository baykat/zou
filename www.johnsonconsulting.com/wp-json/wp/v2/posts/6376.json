In the 1860s, people <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.homefuneralalliance.org\/home-funeral-history.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">dressed and buried bodies at home<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. By the 1900s, formal funeral services became the norm, and now, we\u2019re once again witnessing shifting trends in the funeral profession, with <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.nationalcremation.com\/cremation-information\/why-is-cremation-becoming-more-popular-in-the-us\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">cremations superseding memorial services<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in terms of popularity.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic, the growth of unconventional ways of honoring those who have passed has accelerated, including non-denominational services, virtual services, and unique celebrations of life. As a funeral director, it\u2019s important to stay abreast of these trends, ensuring that your services offer families enticing and current options.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Continuation of Digital Transformation\u00a0<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">These days, more and more of our lives take place through digital means, from shopping to communication and even many of our careers. With eCommerce sales <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.digitalcommerce360.com\/article\/coronavirus-impact-online-retail\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">increasing over 30% in 2020<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, funeral homes that once based the entirety of their business on in-person interactions must consider how to adapt to the digital landscape.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Consider the aspects of your services that would benefit from digital components. One of the easiest ways to start doing this is by examining the ways you interact with families online.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Before buying a product or service, <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.qualtrics.com\/blog\/online-review-stats\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">93% of people read online reviews<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. This is why it\u2019s integral to manage your reputation online. By requesting families to review your business on Google and responding to posts\u2013\u2013both positive and negative\u2013\u2013you can ensure that people find positive third-party accounts of your services, thus increasing their likelihood of booking with you.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Additionally, with more positive reviews, Google begins to recognize your business as trusted which can vastly improve your <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.funeralresultsmarketing.com\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">SEO rankings.<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Modernizing of Buildings<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the wake of the pandemic, many people took time to <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.statista.com\/statistics\/1178141\/home-improvement-done-during-pandemic-us\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">make improvements to their homes<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Similarly, funeral homes with outdated decor could benefit from a facelift. It\u2019s time to pitch those heavy drapes and dilapidated carpets for a fresh new look. When people enter your funeral home\u2013\u2013either for a consultation or to attend a service\u2013\u2013the exterior and interior of your facilities leave a lasting impression. You\u2019ll want to make sure that the look of your business reflects your professionalism.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While taste is subjective, and there\u2019s no universally correct way to furnish a funeral home, there are some general aesthetic guidelines to abide by.<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The grounds and interior of your funeral home should be clean and well maintained.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Any bold color choices can be toned down with neutrals, allowing them to appeal to a wider range of sensibilities.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Consider indoor plants to give a warm feeling. Just make sure they\u2019re real, not silk or other synthetics.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">More Personal Relationships with Funeral Directors\u00a0<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Along with the shift to go more digital, there has also been a huge demand for the personalization of experiences. Customers want to feel like they matter, more than just a transaction. This is especially true in the funeral profession, where morticians and related professionals are often seen as cold and unapproachable.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Instead of worrying about maintaining a professional front, let your guard down and really begin to connect. Perhaps you can maintain text or email correspondence with families. Even dressing a bit more casually outside of formal services can go a long way to establishing cordial relationships with families.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Another way to build relationships is to consider the community in which you\u2019re situated. Are there regular events\u2013\u2013harvest festivals, annual 5K runs, or other fundraisers\u2013\u2013where you can get involved? Alternatively, you could consider hosting an event of your own such as a day of remembrance.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The goal is to demonstrate to your families that you and your team\u2013\u2013while professional and skilled\u2013\u2013are approachable members of the community.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Emphasis on the Customer Experience<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Any business worth its salt is responsive to its clients, and the pandemic has made the ability to adapt more important than ever. Customers now expect more attention, care, and consideration when they work with any business. In the death care profession, where emotions are heightened, funeral directors need to be extra attentive to the needs of their families.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">More people are screening businesses online before making an initial call, and in the event they\u2019re dissatisfied with a purchase, it\u2019s easier than ever for them to air their grievances online. Because of this, you\u2019ll want to develop a strategy to monitor and improve the experience of your families.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Invest in a Customer Experience Tool\u00a0<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While you could hire a full-time customer experience manager, a digital option can perform the same duties for a fraction of the cost. The performance tracker from <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.johnsonconsulting.com\/services\/performance-tracker\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Johnson Consulting Group<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is a software platform that gives you key insights into how families feel about the services of your funeral home. It also allows you to monitor online reviews and stay abreast of trends in the death care profession, giving you the tools to adapt to a changing landscape.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you\u2019re not <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.johnsonconsulting.com\/how-does-your-funeral-home-measure-customer-experience\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">measuring customer experience<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in your funeral home, then you\u2019ll have no way of knowing where you stand to improve.
