We do not sell prepackaged solutions. We customize and craft our programs to fit the specific needs of our clients. Our methods for improving performance are based on proven methods, but our approach to identify what needs attention and how we prioritize the action plans is one of our important and valued qualities that set us apart from the competition.<\/p>\n<p>Our philosophy is simple: We fix what is broken, not what is working. We use a bottom up approach where we engage the staff get their input and build their confidence and trust. Other programs employ top down approach which results in less staff involvement and a low buy in rate. This results in short term solutions that are not sustainable.<\/p>\n<p>The most valued asset any business has is what we refer to as &#8220;Intellectual Capital&#8221;. We define that as the ideas, knowledge and experiences your staff has about your business. Unfortunately, this very valuable asset depreciates rapidly because the people that do the work everyday are often left out of the process.<\/p>\n<p>At Johnson Consulting we use an exhaustive pre-site and on-site analysis to accurately measure client&#8217;s current operating performance and to thoroughly understand client&#8217;s business. Clients receive a Performance Analysis that includes a Customer Service Assessment; Workflow Analysis; Competitive Market Share Assessment; and Financial Analysis. Most of this information is gathered through interviews with the staff.<\/p>\n<p>We are committed to using our extensive industry knowledge and experience to assist our clients to achieve unprecedented levels of customer service, an optimum workplace environment, recognition as the marketplace leader and maximum financial performance. We strive to build long term relationships with our clients as trusted strategic partners to create superior operating performance results ensuring the highest business value.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Our JCG Management Services Approach<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>\u00c2\u00a0<img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/07\/approach.gif\" alt=\"Management Services Approach\" width=\"736\" height=\"560\" align=\"middle\" \/><\/p>\n<p><strong>Our JCG Management Services Focus<\/strong><\/p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Customer service<\/strong> &#8211; consistently deliver exceptional service to your customers;<\/li>\n<li>\u00c2\u00a0<strong>Workplace <\/strong>&#8211; provide an optimum workplace filled with opportunity for employee development;<\/li>\n<li><strong>Marketplace <\/strong>&#8211; actively contribute to the marketplace you serve; and<\/li>\n<li><strong>Financial Management<\/strong> &#8211; master the best financial management practices available.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p><strong>Our Clients<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>&#8220;People don&#8217;t care how much you know until they know how much you care&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Successful funeral and cemetery companies from large to small who have historically excelled in each of the four success steps yet face new and different challenges in customer service, an increasingly complex workplace, a more competitive marketplace and a greater need for precise financial management due to eroding operating margins.<\/p>\n<p>We value our client relationships and truly care about their business. JCG Management Services offers a practical approach to improving productivity that is designed to build on our client&#8217;s many years of success. We provide each client a carefully customized engagement that specifically addresses their greatest business needs with programs that are both effective and affordable.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Our Commitment<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Before beginning any new program, we validate our strategy by asking these three basic fundamental questions:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>Is it good for the customer?<\/li>\n<li>Is it good for the employee?<\/li>\n<li>Is it good for the company?<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>At Johnson Consulting Group, we commit to provide our clients training and performance improvement programs that each benefits the customer, the employee and the company.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Our Team <\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Johnson Consulting Group is comprised of funeral and cemetery operations and financial experts who have over 400 years of combined experience in the death care industry. They have spent their careers owning, operating and managing funeral home and cemetery operations large and small. We are operations specialists who have faced virtually every conceivable funeral business challenge in operating literally thousands of funeral homes and cemeteries throughout the country<\/p>\n<p>JCG is the only Total Solutions Company in the Funeral Industry<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Mergers and Acquisitions<\/li>\n<li>Business <a href=\"https:\/\/www.johnsonconsulting.com\/valuation-services\/\">Valuations<\/a><\/li>\n<li>Web-based Accounting<\/li>\n<li>Management Services<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Today&#8217;s business challenges in overall funeral operations have never been more prevalent and the need for outside expertise is paramount for achieving optimal levels of performance and productivity. &#8220;Single Source&#8221; supplying of funeral products has become more of the norm and a standard pertaining to funeral business&#8217;s purchasing policies and practices.<\/p>\n<p>This same value of &#8220;single sourcing&#8221; in consulting services has not been previously available to the family owned funeral businesses.

Total Client Satisfaction is always our ultimate goal. A true partnership means that one partner should never profit at the expense of the other. We price our services fairly and employ a simple straight forward guarantee. It&#8217;s called &#8220;Pay for Performance&#8221;. Here&#8217;s how it works:<\/p>\n<p>After we complete our Performance Analysis, we identify the areas that need improvement. We then prioritize those areas for highest impact and probability for success. We set the mutual benchmarks we want to achieve. We then ask for full and total support from the ownership.<\/p>\n<p>If we achieve our goals, we get paid. If we do not, we will continue to work to achieve the desired results. If we do not produce the results, we don&#8217;t bill the client for that initiative. It&#8217;s as simple as that.<\/p>\n<p><a title=\"June 2008 Management Insights Newsletter\" href=\"\/2008\/06\/26\/june-2008-management-insights-newsletter\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">A\u00a0Return to the June 2008 Management Insights Newsletter<\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Johnson Consulting Group and Legacy Accounting and Management Services Our Management Services program is uniquely positioned when comparing alternative programs.
