Team member Michaela O&#8217;Leary sat down with Lacy to share her experience of attending this special event.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2>You&#8217;ve mentioned you were a lifelong Elvis fan..Can you expand a little more on that?<\/h2>\n<p>For as long as I can remember I have been an Elvis Presley fan. I share this passion with my best friend, Lauren. We bonded over Elvis in elementary school and he truly is the foundation of our friendship. 30 years ago, Lauren and I hosted an Elvis memorial at a local park. I had cups, plates, and napkins with Johnson Funeral Home printed on them which were left over from my grandfather\u2019s funeral. We marked out Johnson and Home wrote Elvis before Funeral. Honoring the life and legacy of Elvis was something we were always into. Both of us have been to Graceland multiple times throughout our lives and this was our first time going together.<\/p>\n<h2><\/h2>\n<h2>What can you tell us about Lisa Marie\u2019s legacy and the legacy she left on Memphis?<\/h2>\n<p>Following the life of Elvis natural led to following the life of Lisa Marie. For Elvis fans its more than his music. Lisa Marie was a fierce protector of her father\u2019s legacy. Her desire to stay connected to fans is her legacy. In the days following her death I read an Instagram post from David Kessler\u2019s, who had been helping Lisa Marie through her grief after her son\u2019s death. Kessler shared that Lisa Marie opened her home to other bereaved parents to co-lead grief support meetings. Lisa Marie never shied away from connecting with people on a deeply personal level when the opportunity was presented.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2>What service highlights stood out to you the most?<\/h2>\n<p>Walking up to Graceland and taking our place on the front Lauren and I knew this was going to be a memorable tribute. Elvis hymns played during the two hours leading up to the memorial starting and the entire time we were in the procession for Mediation Garden. The performances of Jason Clark &amp; The Tennessee Mass Choir and The Blackwood Brothers Quartet were outstanding. I really appreciated Billy Blackwood recalling the time when Elvis introduced his baby girl Lisa Marie to both him and his father, James Blackwood, Sr.. He also shared that his father sang at the funeral for Elvis\u2019 mother Gladys and the quartet performed at Elvis\u2019 funeral. The Blackwood Brothers Quartet was truly honored to perform Elvis\u2019 favorite hymn, \u201cHow Great Thou Art\u201d and \u201cSweet, Sweet Spirit\u201d at Lisa Marie\u2019s service.<\/p>\n<p>Jerry Schilling, one of Elvis\u2019 closest friends and confidant to Lisa Marie, delivered a beautiful eulogy. He shared details about Lisa Marie being the first baby he had ever held and his nickname for Lisa Marie was \u201cMemphis\u201d. The poem written by one of Lisa Marie\u2019s twin daughters was read by Priscilla Presley. It was poignant and heartbreaking. Priscilla\u2019s final words were, \u201cBut the old soul is always with me. She doesn&#8217;t drift above.&#8217; That says it all and thank you all for being here. Our heart is broken. Lisa, we all love you.&#8221; The letter written by Lisa Marie\u2019s daughter Riley which was read by her husband, Ben-Smith-Peterson was incredibly moving. In it Riley wrote, \u201cI hope I can love my daughter the way you loved me, the way you loved my brother and my sisters\u201d. That was the first time it was made public that Lisa Marie was a grandmother. It was a very stirring moment during the memorial.<\/p>\n<div id=\"attachment_7240\" style=\"width: 357px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.johnsonconsulting.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/IMG_5437-1-scaled.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-7240\" class=\"wp-image-7240\" src=\"https:\/\/www.johnsonconsulting.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/IMG_5437-1-300x225.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"347\" height=\"260\" \/><\/a><p id=\"caption-attachment-7240\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">We had a direct view of family members and celebrity guests arriving to the memorial and walking to their seats under the tent.

We recognized Baz Luhrmann, director of the movie Elvis and Linda Ramone when they arrived as well.<\/p><\/div>\n<h2><\/h2>\n<h2>How did the service differ from other services you\u2019ve attended?<\/h2>\n<p>I had this same conversation with Ed Defort of NFDA because there were noticeable differences that him and I picked up on. There was a depth to the service that was certainly unique. The combination of live performances, poems, a letter, and eulogies gave the entire tribute layers. There was seamless flow to the order of service. I especially like the Sarah Ferguson, Duchess of York message was titled \u201cA Tribute to the Children\u201d. Speaking directly to Lisa Marie\u2019s children offering hope and support was one of the most special parts of the service.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2>Where did you stay when you traveled to the service? Did the place you stayed do anything special for the service?<\/h2>\n<p>Lauren and I decided to make the drive down to Memphis the minute memorial plans were made public. I immediately clicked on my Marriott app to secure a room at the Courtyard Marriot less than three miles from Graceland. The location of the Courtyard Marriot was perfect. But it was the hospitality from this hotel that impressed me the most. There was a beautifully written tribute from the general manager honoring the life of Lisa Marie with an invitation to have peanut butter banana sandwiches and wine in the lobby. The hotel also offered a complimentary shuttle to and from Graceland for guests. It was evident that the city of Memphis truly loved and cared about Lisa Marie. I left a glowing review for this hotel when I returned home. The General Manager emailed me after reading the review and acknowledging Lisa Marie\u2019s service and thanked me for choosing that hotel.<\/p>\n<div id=\"attachment_7241\" style=\"width: 540px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.johnsonconsulting.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/IMG_5477-scaled.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-7241\" class=\"wp-image-7241\" src=\"https:\/\/www.johnsonconsulting.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/IMG_5477-300x225.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"530\" height=\"397\" \/><\/a><p id=\"caption-attachment-7241\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">This was the procession line which extended from Elvis Presley Blvd all the way to Meditation Garden.
