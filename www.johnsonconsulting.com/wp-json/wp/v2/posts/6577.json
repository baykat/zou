Detailed financials are not only an essential part of planning, but they also come in handy when figuring out <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.johnsonconsulting.com\/funeral-home-taxes\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">what you owe in taxes<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Rather than employ a full-time bookkeeper, most small business owners turn to the help of accounting software. When implemented effectively, accounting software can streamline the processes of recording payments, tracking expenses, and invoicing clients. But it\u2019s important to remember that not all accounting software is created equally. Moreover, not all accounting software is the right fit for every type of business.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here are some questions to ask when purchasing funeral home accounting software.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Does It Have the Tools You Need?<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">First and foremost, the software you choose should make things easier, not more complicated. In addition to making sure a digital tool has an intuitive and functional interface, you\u2019ll also want to make sure that it has all the functionality you need. For most funeral homes, this might include software that automatically records transactions, oversees invoicing, connects with business bank accounts, automates payroll processes, and monitors IRS compliance.<br \/>\n<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ease of Use<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While you\u2019ll undoubtedly call on the help of an accounting professional during tax season, the goal of accounting software is to allow you to accomplish the same functions in the meantime\u2013and with ease. You shouldn\u2019t have to take a course or get tutoring to learn how to use it. Luckily, many accounting software platforms offer free or discounted trial periods.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Do You Prefer Desktop or Cloud-Based?<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While desktop-based accounting software used to be the norm, cloud-based programs are quickly eclipsing them in popularity. Before you decide on which type of software to use, it\u2019s important to understand the differences between them.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Desktop<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The main benefits of desktop software are security and pricing. Accounting solutions like <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/quickbooks.intuit.com\/oa\/get-quickbooks\/?cid=ppc_G_e_US_.QB_US_GGL_Brand_Top-Terms_Exact_Search_Desktop._quickbooks_txt&amp;gclid=Cj0KCQiA3fiPBhCCARIsAFQ8QzU6-IesGPdeRvHLoDEftqDiRL2G0tW1W9jANwjzbyqTo4uRos2_yvwaAmR3EALw_wcB&amp;gclsrc=aw.ds\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">QuickBooks<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.sage.com\/en-us\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sage<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> may cost a lower annual subscription fee,\u00a0 and all of your data is stored in your local computer, meaning only that computer can access your records.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The primary downside of desktop solutions is accessibility. The computer on which you install this software is the only one that can use it. If anything happens to that computer, all your data may be lost. To share records with your accountant, you\u2019ll have to manually print or download and email them.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cloud-Based<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While desktop accounting software offers a lower annual fee , cloud-based software excels when it comes to accessibility and sharing. Since all of your data is stored on a cloud server, you can access your records from anywhere. Cloud-based accounting software like \u200b\u200bQuickbooks Online (QBO) and <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.xero.com\/us\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Xero<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> even includes smartphone apps, meaning multiple users can access or alter records from any number of devices.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The primary downside of cloud-based accounting software is in the pricing structure. While prices vary by provider, you\u2019ll most likely have to pay a monthly fee.Can It Integrate with Your Bank?<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It\u2019s important that your funeral home accounting software can help you pay bills and employees, but another key component is its ability to integrate with your bank. Most accounting software allows for this; however, not every software is compatible with every bank.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Security<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Most cloud-based software will employ firewalls and encryption measures to secure your data, so outside interference is rarely a concern. What you\u2019ll also want to look for is user security. For most funeral homes, you\u2019ll have multiple people accessing your account. That\u2019s why you want to ensure you have the capability to adjust the privileges of these different users, limiting access to\u00a0 specific functions and information. For example, you might not want your employees to view the salaries of other team members.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Does It Limit Transactions?<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Accounting software often comes in different sizes, limiting the number of transactions you can process in a given period. In the event that you plan to scale your business\u2013\u2013or your funeral home experiences a high volume of sales\u2013\u2013be sure your software can adapt.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For example, platforms like Xero have a monthly transaction limit of 1,000. Luckily, when you exceed this limit, you can upgrade your software to accommodate additional transactions.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How Is The Customer Service?<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As streamlined as most accounting software is, you\u2019ll undoubtedly run into issues. Whether it&#8217;s a matter of understanding the program or a technical glitch, ample customer support is crucial.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In many cases, the purchase of accounting software includes remote training courses. The best accounting software platforms will also offer a dedicated support line where you can access experts to help you mitigate any technical issues.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Have You Gotten an Accountant\u2019s Opinion?<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Consider asking your accountant for their software recommendations. This might also help them more effectively find the information they need from your account.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Funeral Home Accountants<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Compared to traditional accountants, an accountant who specializes in the funeral industry can better help you monitor your financial health. While accounting software makes for more efficient tracking of data, only a funeral accounting expert can help you make better sense of these numbers.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Whether you\u2019re looking to avoid tax season headaches or get a clearer picture of your financial health, the accountants at <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.johnsonconsulting.com\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Johnson Consulting Group<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> can help.
