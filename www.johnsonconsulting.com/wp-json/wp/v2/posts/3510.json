Nearly all states have approved and adopted these qualified tuition\u00a0programs (QTPs). Most states let nonresidents participate in their plans, although the\u00a0tax benefits may be greater for residents than for nonresidents.\u00a0The beneficiary can use 529 plan account balances at any eligible postsecondary\u00a0educational institution in the United States or certain schools abroad for qualified\u00a0expenses. Qualified expenses cover tuition, room and board, books, equipment, and\u00a0supplies related to enrollment or attendance at the eligible institution. The account\u00a0owner retains control of the assets and can change beneficiaries within the designated\u00a0beneficiary\u2019s family at any time without penalty. Other key advantages of these\u00a0plans are:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Federal-income-tax-free qualified distributions. The beneficiary may be able\u00a0to take qualified distributions federal-income-tax-free.<\/li>\n<li>No income limitations for participation. There is no income limit for\u00a0contributing to a 529 plan, which is a benefit for higher-income families.<\/li>\n<li>Substantial contribution amounts. Contribution limits are significantly higher\u00a0than those allowed for an ESA (see next bullet point). Maximum account balance\u00a0limits vary from state to state.<\/li>\n<li>Significant estate-planning benefits. Due to a special provision unique to 529\u00a0plans, a single person can contribute up to $70,000 in one year per beneficiary; a\u00a0married couple can contribute up to $140,000 in one year per beneficiary\u00a0with no\u00a0gift-tax consequences.\u2020 Such a contribution will be considered a five-year\u00a0accelerated annual-exclusion gift ($14,000 for 2015), so no additional gifts can be\u00a0made for that beneficiary for this year and the next four years without incurring\u00a0gift-tax implications unless the annual gift exclusion increases. Not only are you\u00a0able to jump start your education savings, but this accelerated gifting technique\u00a0also allows you to reduce your estate by the gift amount and any subsequent\u00a0appreciation. (A portion of the contribution amount may be included in the donor\u2019s\u00a0taxable-estate calculation if the donor should die within the five-year period.)<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><em>* Total yearly costs for in-state tuition, fees, books, room and board (transportation, and miscellaneous expenses\u00a0not included).

The plan\u2019s chosen investment manager\u00a0will be responsible\u00a0for the day-to-day portfolio management of all contributions.\u00a0Initially, you select from several asset-allocation-model alternatives, which\u00a0generally you may change only twice every calendar year and\/or with a\u00a0beneficiary change.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><em>An investment in a 529 plan will fluctuate such that the shares when redeemed may\u00a0be worth more or less than the original investment. There are no guarantees that an\u00a0investment in a 529 plan will cover higher-education expenses. Investors should consult\u00a0the plan\u2019s offering document for the fees and expenses associated with that plan. You\u00a0should consider a 529 plan\u2019s investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses carefully\u00a0before investing. The plan\u2019s official statement, which contains this and other important\u00a0information, should be read carefully before investing.<\/em><\/p>\n<h4><strong>Frequently asked questions<\/strong><\/h4>\n<p><strong>Can securities be contributed to a 529 plan?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>No. Contributions to 529 plans must be made in cash.<\/p>\n<p><strong>How will my contributions be invested?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Typically your contribution is invested in a predetermined portfolio of stocks, bonds and\u00a0cash. These portfolios are managed by the plan\u2019s chosen investment firm. In general, owners\u00a0designate a certain allocation model at the time of the original contribution and can change\u00a0this investment model twice every calendar year and\/or when they change the beneficiary.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Can I change the beneficiary after I\u2019ve made a contribution?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>You may change your 529 savings plan account beneficiary to another qualified family\u00a0member of the designated beneficiary without triggering income tax consequences.\u00a0A qualified family member generally includes siblings, descendants, ancestors, aunts,\u00a0uncles and first cousins (defined in IRS publication 970). If you change the beneficiary to<br \/>\na descendant of the designated beneficiary, you will trigger a gift equal to the value\u00a0transferred from the 529 account. If the value is more than the annual exclusion (or\u00a0five-year accelerated annual exclusion), you must report it as a \u201ctaxable gift.\u201d<\/p>\n<p><strong>Can 529 distributions be used for vocational schools?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Potentially. An &#8220;eligible&#8221; institution is any college, university, vocational school or other\u00a0post secondary educational institution eligible to participate in the U.S. Department of\u00a0Education student aid program.<\/p>\n<p><strong>What happens if the account balance is not used for qualified\u00a0higher-education expenses?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Every withdrawal from a 529 plan is separated into two components: an \u201cearnings\u201d\u00a0portion and a \u201creturn of your investment\u201d portion.<\/p>\n<p>The return of your investment in the 529 plan is never subject to federal income tax. On the\u00a0other hand, if a withdrawal is not used for qualified higher-education expenses, the earnings\u00a0portion of the withdrawal is subject to income tax and potentially a 10% IRS penalty.\u00a0Some exceptions to the penalty may be available. For example, if the beneficiary dies,\u00a0becomes disabled or receives a tax free scholarship, you may take penalty-free\u00a0nonqualified distributions from the 529 balance within that same tax year. See IRS\u00a0publication 970 at irs.gov for more exceptions.<\/p>\n<p><strong>How will 529 plan investment balances affect eligibility for financial aid?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Assets in a 529 account are included in the federal financial aid calculation as follows:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>If a parent owns the 529 account, up to 5.64% of the value is included in Expected\u00a0Family Contribution (EFC) as a parental asset. Any 529 accounts owned by a\u00a0dependent student or by a custodian for the student are reported on the Free\u00a0Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) as a parental asset. Any qualified\u00a0withdrawals from these accounts are not included as income to the student.<\/li>\n<li>If a 529 account is owned by a grandparent (or someone other than a parent or\u00a0the student), the account\u2019s value is not reportable as an asset on the FAFSA\u00a0financial aid application. However, any distributions from these third-party\u00a0accounts are considered financial support to the student and are reportable on\u00a0the following year\u2019s FAFSA as student income. Student income is assessed at\u00a0the student\u2019s 50% rate.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>The above information pertains to the federal FAFSA calculation. Some schools\u00a0may use an institutional formula, which may assess assets differently and produce\u00a0a different aid determination. Ask your Financial Advisor for a copy of our report,\u00a0&#8220;An introduction to college financial aid&#8221; for more details.<\/p>\n<p><strong>How does a 529 plan compare with more traditional college-savings vehicles,\u00a0such as custodial accounts, ESAs, etc.?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The table on page 4 briefly describes the features of various college-savings vehicles.\u00a0For a more complete discussion and comparison of these types of vehicles, ask your\u00a0Financial Advisor for a copy of our education-planning brochure, \u201cSaving for Soaring\u00a0College Costs.\u201d<\/p>\n<p><strong>Can I transfer existing Uniform Gift to Minors Act\/Uniform Transfer to\u00a0Minors Act (UGMA\/UTMA) balances into a 529 plan?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Yes, but 529 plan contributions must be made in cash, so if you choose to use\u00a0UGMA\/UTMA funds, your UGMA\/UTMA assets must be liquidated (possibly\u00a0triggering income tax consequences) before making your 529 contribution. You will\u00a0need to transfer the funds into a custodial 529 plan account. Once there they will have\u00a0the opportunity to grow tax-deferred, and qualified distributions may be federal income\u00a0tax free, the same as a noncustodial 529 plan. Nonqualified withdrawals from either a\u00a0custodial or noncustodial 529 plan account may trigger ordinary income taxes and a\u00a010% penalty.<\/p>\n<p>There are two important differences to be aware of when funding a 529 plan with\u00a0UGMA\/UTMA funds. First, you should be aware that you are not allowed to change the\u00a0beneficiary on custodial 529 plan accounts. Second, the UGMA\/UTMA assets you\u00a0transfer into the account will continue to be governed by the control rules involving\u00a0UGMA\/UTMA assets. That is, the beneficiary may gain control of those assets when\u00a0attaining the age upon which custodianship ends.<\/p>\n<p>You should also be aware that assets in a UGMA\/UTMA account can be used for a\u00a0variety of purposes without penalty. They are not restricted to educational expenses as\u00a0with a custodial 529 plan. A better strategy may be to maintain the UGMA\/UTMA\u00a0assets for expenses not considered qualified by the 529 plan and direct new education\u00a0savings into a 529 plan for qualified expenses.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.johnsonconsulting.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/529-Plans-Compare.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-3545\" src=\"https:\/\/www.johnsonconsulting.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/529-Plans-Compare-450x582.jpg\" alt=\"529 Plans-Compare\" width=\"430\" height=\"556\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.johnsonconsulting.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/529-Plans-Compare-450x582.jpg 450w, https:\/\/www.johnsonconsulting.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/529-Plans-Compare-700x906.jpg 700w, https:\/\/www.johnsonconsulting.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/529-Plans-Compare-250x324.jpg 250w, https:\/\/www.johnsonconsulting.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/529-Plans-Compare-120x155.jpg 120w, https:\/\/www.johnsonconsulting.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/529-Plans-Compare-512x663.jpg 512w, https:\/\/www.johnsonconsulting.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/529-Plans-Compare-348x450.jpg 348w, https:\/\/www.johnsonconsulting.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/529-Plans-Compare.jpg 1700w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 430px) 100vw, 430px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p><strong>Can I make a gift to a custodial account and a 529 plan in the same year?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Yes, within certain limitations. A gift to a custodial account is limited to the annual\u00a0gift-exclusion amount ($14,000 for individuals, $28,000 for married couples) without\u00a0affecting your lifetime gift-tax-exclusion amount ($5.43 million in 2015). However, a\u00a0gift to a 529 plan that is in excess of the annual gift-exclusion amount may be\u00a0considered a five-year accelerated annual-exclusion gift if properly elected as such on a\u00a0gift tax return.<\/p>\n<p>For example, if you made a $35,000 contribution in one year to a 529 savings plan\u00a0and elected the five-year accelerated annual exclusion gift on the gift tax return, your\u00a0contribution would be treated as a $7,000 gift in the current year and each of the\u00a0next four years. In that same year, you may gift an additional $7,000 to the same\u00a0beneficiary in a custodial account (reaching your one-year total of $14,000, the annual\u00a0gift-exclusion limit for 2015). If each spouse of a married couple gifted $35,000, the\u00a0couple would be able to double these gifts.*<\/p>\n<p><strong>How can I maximize the 529 plan\u2019s estate-planning benefits?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Affluent families may want to contribute as much as possible into a 529 plan, both\u00a0to fund college expenses for beneficiaries and to move assets out of a taxable estate.\u00a0These families should consider making the maximum annual exclusion gift\u00a0contribution ($70,000 for an individual or $140,000 for a married couple using the\u00a0five-year lump-sum election) in a single year.<\/p>\n<p>Think twice if this is your goal and you are close to the end of the year. By maximizing\u00a0that contribution this year, you use your annual-exclusion gift amount for that\u00a0beneficiary for the next four years. That means four more years must pass before you\u00a0can again contribute to that 529 plan account for that beneficiary without gift-tax\u00a0consequences. If, instead, you make one year\u2019s annual exclusion gift for a beneficiary\u00a0before year end, ($14,000 for an individual or $28,000 for a married couple) and then\u00a0maximize your 529 plan contribution in the new year, you can contribute up to $84,000\u00a0(individuals) or $168,000 (married couples) within a matter of months rather than\u00a0over six years, as illustrated below:*<\/p>\n<h4><strong>Maximizing the estate-planning benefits of a 529 plan<\/strong><\/h4>\n<p><strong>For a married couple<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignleft  wp-image-3546\" src=\"https:\/\/www.johnsonconsulting.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/Contribution-WF-450x162.jpg\" alt=\"Contribution WF\" width=\"375\" height=\"135\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.johnsonconsulting.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/Contribution-WF-450x162.jpg 450w, https:\/\/www.johnsonconsulting.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/Contribution-WF-700x251.jpg 700w, https:\/\/www.johnsonconsulting.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/Contribution-WF-250x90.jpg 250w, https:\/\/www.johnsonconsulting.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/Contribution-WF-120x43.jpg 120w, https:\/\/www.johnsonconsulting.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/Contribution-WF-512x184.jpg 512w, https:\/\/www.johnsonconsulting.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/Contribution-WF.jpg 724w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 375px) 100vw, 375px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><em>* This hypothetical example is designed to illustrate the effect of certain planning strategies based on\u00a0stated assumptions.
