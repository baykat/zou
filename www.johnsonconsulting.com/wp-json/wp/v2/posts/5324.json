It\u2019s a big decision, full of excitement and new adventures but there can also be complications and unforeseen obstacles. It\u2019s also tricky to determine if the timing is right to enter the funeral market. Some buyers forge ahead quickly to take advantage of the favorable conditions, while others plan carefully and triple-check all the details before making a move. Whether your plan is to own one or ten funeral homes in the future, here are a few things you should consider before you buy a funeral business.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the current pandemic environment, it\u2019s increasingly clear that certain long-term plans are no longer strategically viable. To weather the economic challenges brought on by COVID-19, many business owners have had to pivot from long-haul strategic plans to short-term goals that are more flexible in nature. As the saying goes, \u201cChange is the only constant in life,\u201d and the funeral profession has experienced significant change over the past few years (even before coronavirus was a thing). So if you are in the market to buy, do your due diligence and research market trends so you can readily adapt your purchase plans if necessary.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2><strong>Keep Up with Market Trends<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Keeping up with market trends is an important task for any business owner. Identifying and understanding the factors that cause market changes can help your funeral home stay relevant and up-to-date with new products and services. Staying in front of trends can also generate brand loyalty and improve profitability in the long run. Some recent business trends funeral home professionals should be following include:<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><strong>Fewer Full-Service Funerals\/Cremations<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Starting in March 2020, many families were unable to hold visitations or funeral services for their loved ones due to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.cdc.gov\/coronavirus\/2019-ncov\/community\/funeral-faqs.html?fbclid=IwAR02ZloUTjudD69uOL5SQVi24rbRjrrvgnxuL8NhbnhA646dO6gvvdGeHvw\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">COVID restrictions<\/a> on public gatherings and strict social distancing guidelines. Some families postponed their plans for a full-service funeral to a later date, or opted for a graveside service or direct burial\/cremation. This \u201cput off until later\u201d trend may be temporary for now, but it\u2019s likely that some families will continue to choose limited arrangements going forward.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><strong>The Rise of Technology<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Many funeral homes scrambled to provide virtual arrangements, live-streamed funerals and memorial websites to meet customer demand, and firms that were able to offer convenient online service options handily beat the competition. User-friendly technology is simply a \u201cmust-have\u201d for funeral and cemetery businesses in today\u2019s market, and making the right tech investment is key to maintaining productivity.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><strong>Changing Target Audience Dynamics<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The coronavirus health crisis has brought mortality to the forefront. Millennials and younger generations are now more aware that tomorrow is not promised, and this realization may lead to an increase in demand for funeral pre-planning services and preneed arrangements.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><strong>Low Interest Rates<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Money is cheap thanks to current low interest rates, and this is good for both buyers and sellers. Low interest rates give buyers greater purchasing power as they can obtain loans with favorable terms in a competitive lending market. Sellers also benefit because low rates mean there is a greater pool of potential buyers who can afford to purchase their property.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2><strong>Is it a Buyer\u2019s Market or a Seller\u2019s Market?<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Another important consideration for those getting into the funeral profession is whether it\u2019s a buyer\u2019s market or seller\u2019s market. The answer to this question depends on supply and demand (although sometimes pure luck can be a factor in the equation), but it\u2019s not always easy to figure out how the market moves.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Some experts say it is currently a buyer\u2019s market, as the pandemic crisis has negatively affected profits for certain funeral homes which could mean lower selling prices when put up for sale. Owners in the 55+ age bracket may be more willing to accept a quick sale because they don\u2019t have the energy to face another COVID-like disaster and are not adequately prepared for a transition. &#8220;Fewer and fewer owners have the next generation involved in the business which means there is not an automatic succession plan in place,\u201d says Bob Ekins, Director of Business Development at Johnson Consulting Group (JCG).<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ekins notes that the present funeral home market can also be viewed as a seller\u2019s market. \u201cIn addition to money being readily available for buyers, today\u2019s sellers are reaping the benefits of the ever-increasing competition amongst the local, regional and national companies all looking to add additional revenue and cash flow.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><strong>Both Markets Reign<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Jake Johnson, President &amp; Chief Executive Office of JCG, believes it is both a buyer\u2019s and a seller\u2019s market. \u201cThere are investors out there looking to diversify in the funeral profession. So it is a seller\u2019s market if you have your financials in order to show the investor that your business is a smart investment. If you have a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.johnsonconsulting.com\/7-mistakes-of-succession-planning\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">succession plan<\/a> in place and you know how to treat your employees, you\u2019ll sell even better.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cFor the buyer\u2019s the opportunities come from the people,\u201d Johnson continues. \u201cThis is an especially good opportunity when the seller isn&#8217;t fully educated on the market and the buying and selling process. This is why having a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.johnsonconsulting.com\/selling-funeral-or-cemetery-business\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">business broker<\/a> is beneficial. When there isn&#8217;t a clear understanding of current financials they often sell for less. As a buyer, you\u2019re in a good place when you have options and many businesses to choose from, and there are plenty of businesses for sale right now.&#8221;<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2><strong>Ask the Experts<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Johnson Consulting Group specializes in funeral home and cemetery acquisitions.
