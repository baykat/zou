Currently, the death care industry is undergoing drastic changes. According to a <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/nfda.org\/news\/media-center\/nfda-news-releases\/id\/6012\/turning-to-tradition-more-than-a-quarter-of-americans-embrace-religion-in-post-covid-funeral-planning\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">2021 report<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> from the National Funeral Directors Association, rates of cremation are on the rise, people are interested in \u201cgreen\u201d funeral practices, and over half of people surveyed have attended memorial services in non-traditional environments, that is, neither in a funeral home or house of worship.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The times are quickly changing, and so are the ways in which we honor our loved ones. But before you throw all tradition out the window, it\u2019s important to look at the bigger picture. Trends of taste rarely play out in linear fashions. Moreover, recent funeral home preferences believe the persistent need for conventional services. Bottom line: it\u2019s easy to assume we know what families want, but the truth is a bit more complex.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here are some of the most common misconceptions about funeral families and what funeral d<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">irectors should be doing instead.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">1. They Only Want Direct Cremation<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The data is clear; rates of cremation are on the rise, and they\u2019re expected to nearly double those of traditional burials within the next decade. This has caused widespread worry among death care professionals, many of whom are unsure how to make up for the diminished revenue projections.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While the average price of a funeral varies widely\u2013\u2013both by location and the type of arrangement\u2013\u2013the 2021 <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/nfda.org\/news\/media-center\/nfda-news-releases\/id\/6182\/2021-nfda-general-price-list-study-shows-funeral-costs-not-rising-as-fast-as-rate-of-inflation\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">median cost of a funeral<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> with a viewing and burial is $7,848. On the other end of the spectrum, you have direct cremations, which can cost as low as $1,000 and even less from a dedicated crematorium. Although a rise in the popularity of direct cremations seems disheartening in terms of profits, this statistic neglects to account for the number of people who seek services beyond the mere cremation itself.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A Return to Tradition<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For a long period of time, the pandemic made it unfeasible\u2013\u2013if not outright illegal\u2013\u2013for large groups of people to gather. Naturally, this caused the rates of formal funeral services to plunge, at least temporarily. With the arrival of vaccines and the lifting of in-person restrictions, funeral and memorial services can resume; however, we\u2019ve yet to see an uptick in the rate of in-person services compared to cremations.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With that said, Covid has caused an unexpected spike in Americans\u2019 personal faith. According to the National Funeral Directors Association, the number of people who view religion as an<\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/nfda.org\/news\/media-center\/nfda-news-releases\/id\/6012\/turning-to-tradition-more-than-a-quarter-of-americans-embrace-religion-in-post-covid-funeral-planning\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> integral component of a funeral<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> has risen. In 2019, this number was only 35.4%, and by 2021, it rose to 47.3%. These numbers demonstrate the prevalent desire for traditional rituals in the wake of a person\u2019s passing, and there\u2019s no reason that cremation cannot be a part of this.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While the factors contributing to a rise in cremation are multiple and varied, people still have a need for closure through celebrations of life and collective grieving. This is where funeral homes can come into play. Rather than settling for direct cremation, funeral directors can educate the importance of formal services. Imparting to families the need to take time to gather as a group and remember their lost loved ones.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">2. They Won\u2019t Take Time to Leave Reviews<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As we all know, a key component of running a funeral business is monitoring feedback from families. With that said, when a person is grieving a loss\u2013\u2013not to mention navigating the ensuing financial and legal matters\u2013\u2013the last thing you\u2019ll want to do is tactlessly demand more of their time with lengthy surveys. When requested carefully and sincerely, however, you can ensure you\u2019ll obtain valuable feedback.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If your funeral reviews are low, it\u2019s likely not because families choose not to leave them, but rather that they\u2019re not being asked properly. Part of aftercare is asking families how they felt about their experience, giving them space to explain which aspects of their services worked for them. These conversations can naturally segue into more in-depth discussions about particular aspects of your funeral business. Additionally, you can consider following up through email with your families. Reach out to check on how they\u2019re doing, provide resources within the community, and politely request their thoughts on your services.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Companies like J3Tech Solutions have <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.j3techsolutions.com\/performance-tracker\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">automated solutions to the survey process<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Their Performance Tracker X software can help you draft and disseminate surveys to families that will be sent through email. It then records the responses and stores them so funeral directors can review, seeing which aspects of the funeral home are working and those that need help.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">3. They Will Remain Loyal<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There was a time when funeral directors could faithfully rely on the loyalty of the families in their communities. As of 2019, however, there are <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.statista.com\/statistics\/882963\/number-of-funeral-homes-in-the-united-states\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">nearly 20,000 funeral homes<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in the United States, and that number has remained relatively stable over the past couple of decades, potentially indicating a level of market saturation. With the number of options available and the importance placed on customer experience, families no longer feel the need to stick with a specific funeral home.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/blog.hubspot.com\/news-trends\/customer-acquisition-study?__hstc=238111519.07c2c28e6f122664881dc5e9e269aa18.1639256636918.1639256636918.1639256636918.1&amp;__hssc=238111519.1.1639256636919&amp;__hsfp=1887402466\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">93% of people<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> are likely to return to a business that provides excellent customer service. Alternatively, <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.business2community.com\/customer-experience\/59-of-customers-dont-return-after-a-bad-customer-service-experience-01306480#:~:text=59%25%20of%20Customers%20Don't,Service%20Experience%20%2D%20Business%202%20Community\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">more than half of people<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> won\u2019t return to a business where they encountered poor service. With the increased emotion and stress related to funerals, it doesn\u2019t take much to make a family feel the need to go elsewhere. Considering more than 80% of your business will come from 20% of your loyal clients, it\u2019s crucial to do everything you can to cultivate loyalty.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here are some strategies to consider to improve the loyalty of your families:<\/span><b><\/b><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li aria-level=\"1\"><b>Customer service that exceeds expectations:<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> While it\u2019s easy to think of customer service in binary terms\u2013\u2013<\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Did the customer get what they paid for?<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u2013\u2013exceptional customer service involves providing the client with something extra through every step of the process. From the initial interactions to your aftercare, your team should anticipate the needs of families and meet them without needing to be asked or paid an extra fee.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<ul>\n<li aria-level=\"1\"><b>Implementing aftercare initiatives: <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After the successful completion of a funeral service, you should keep in regular contact with families. In addition to checking in to request feedback, you should also regularly reach out and check how people are coping with the loss of loved ones. The goal here is not to sell additional services but rather to demonstrate your commitment to families and their well-being.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<ul>\n<li aria-level=\"1\"><b>Engaging with the community: <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When it comes to keeping your business top of mind, it will benefit your funeral home to become an active <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.johnsonconsulting.com\/funeral-home-strategies-partnerships\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">participant in the community<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. This could include attending local fairs and fundraising events\u2013\u2013or even hosting one of your own. Much like policemen, firefighters, and teachers, funeral professionals are an integral part of their communities. As such, they should reach out when possible.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<ul>\n<li aria-level=\"1\"><b>Cultivating personal relationships: <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Another way to become more active in the community involves creating personal connections with families beyond working relationships. For most people, funeral professionals can come off as aloof or even scary. This is due to the nature of their interactions with funeral directors. If you only see a person in the wake of a loved one\u2019s passing, then this creates a negative association. To combat this, funeral directors should show an interest in people beyond their grief and funeral needs\u2013don\u2019t be afraid to reach out for a coffee, have conversations at community events, send them a holiday card.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Remain Up-to-Date<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With such a quickly changing profession, it\u2019s important to keep up with demands and provide a safe, comfortable, trusting environment for families. Even more important is making sure they know that your services can adapt to a changing landscape. Funerals, cremations, and memorials are not a one-size-fits-all kind of service.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You\u2019ll want to ensure your marketing and communication strategies reflect this, as well. When a person finds your website or consults with one of your agents, are they equipped with the knowledge they need to make the most of your services? Are they informed of all of the options available? To help ensure that your funeral business is prepared for the contemporary challenges of the death care profession, you might want to seek help from experienced consultants.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Johnson Consulting Group is one of the largest consulting firms dedicated to death care businesses.
