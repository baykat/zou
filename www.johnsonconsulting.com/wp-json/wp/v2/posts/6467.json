Funeral homes provide services that everyone eventually needs, but many prefer not to think about. Because of this, you\u2019ll need to carefully develop your marketing strategy, starting with a SWOT analysis.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When thoroughly completed, a SWOT analysis will provide you with an in-depth picture of where your business currently stands, providing you with key insights as to how to plan for the future. If you\u2019ve been neglecting a SWOT analysis, the time is now.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What is a SWOT Analysis?<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">SWOT\u2013\u2013an acronym for strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats\u2013\u2013refers to a tool used to better understand a business\u2019s competitive position. By assessing factors like internal operations, as well as those of a company\u2019s context, this framework gives business owners a realistic idea of where their company is positioned.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Strengths<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Strengths can refer to areas in which your funeral home currently excels. This category also includes anything that sets your business apart from the competition. For example, a fine-tuned aftercare program or an extensive backlog of <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.johnsonconsulting.com\/increase-your-preneed-sales-with-these-7-tips\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">preneed sales<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> would all qualify as strengths.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Weaknesses<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Weaknesses refer to any aspect of your business that stands to grow or improve. For example, a high rate of turnover or a lack of cremation services could be classified as weaknesses.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Opportunities<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Opportunities are any external factors that could present a boon to your business. For example, a growing local population would present a great opportunity for a funeral home. Alternatively, an opportunity could be tied to your weakness.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While a lack of cremation services can be seen as a weakness, this also presents an opportunity, as you could purchase new equipment or cultivate a relationship with a local crematorium.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Threats<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Threats refer to any factors, internal or external, that could serve to harm your business. For example, a growing disinterest in traditional burials has posed a threat to many funeral homes.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Why is a SWOT Analysis Important?<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As John Lennon once said, \u201cHow can I go forward when I don\u2019t know which way I\u2019m facing?\u201d To move forward with a business, you\u2019ll need to know where you currently stand. Otherwise, you could find yourself putting your time and effort in the wrong places.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A SWOT analysis not only provides a clear picture of the present situation but also the inspiration for strategic planning. By examining strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats, you\u2019ll be able to:<\/span><b><\/b><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li aria-level=\"1\"><b>Figure out what\u2019s working: <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While profits are a good measure of a business\u2019s health, numbers alone can be opaque. By pinning down the specific strengths that contribute to your bottom line, you can better determine the keystones of your business and leverage them.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<ul>\n<li aria-level=\"1\"><b>Articulate what stands to improve: <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For funeral homes, any underperforming component of your business can be turned into a strength. The first step is identifying areas for growth.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<ul>\n<li aria-level=\"1\"><b>Create strategic objectives: <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Once you have a clear picture of your business\u2019s current positioning, you\u2019ll be able to plan strategically, both for imminent objectives and those years down the line.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How Do You Perform a SWOT Analysis?<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To conduct a SWOT analysis, you\u2019ll first need to put someone in charge of the project. This person could be an internal leader; however, it\u2019s often best to utilize <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.johnsonconsulting.com\/services\/business-consulting\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">third party funeral and cemetery experts<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, as they\u2019ll be able to provide you with unbiased information.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Additionally, you\u2019ll want to figure out an overarching goal for the SWOT analysis. Are you looking to introduce a new product or service? Are you looking to create a five-year plan? Articulating your objective can help you decide which information to pay close attention to.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The next step of a SWOT analysis is research\u2013\u2013a lot of it. Identifying the strengths and weaknesses of a business requires careful examination, both in terms of day-to-day operations and financial data. Moreover, identifying opportunities and threats requires a greater knowledge of the death care industry.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A Better Option\u00a0<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Depending on the size of your business, a SWOT analysis can take weeks or months of research and work. More importantly, if you want to ensure the work is accurate and unbiased, it\u2019s usually best to rely on the help of an unbiased independent analyst. Otherwise, the data you pull from your analysis might lead you in the wrong direction.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Armed with their extensive experience in the funeral profession, <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.johnsonconsulting.com\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Johnson Consulting Group<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> can curate an accurate reflection of your funeral home.
