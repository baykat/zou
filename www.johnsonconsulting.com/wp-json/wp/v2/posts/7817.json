With approximately 18,000 funeral homes in the U.S., and 80% of those handling 100 or fewer calls annually, many current owners are facing succession. This creates a prime opportunity for funeral directors to step up and become business owners.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>However, the allure of ownership should be approached with careful consideration. While the idea of having the freedom to set your own schedule and make decisions without supervision is appealing, there are inherent challenges. Being a good funeral director doesn\u2019t necessarily equate to being a good manager, and similarly, good managers don\u2019t always make good owners. It&#8217;s critical to recognize personal inadequacies and work on developing the skills necessary to succeed as an owner.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/funeraldirectordaily.com\/going-into-business-on-your-own\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">As Tom noted in his article<\/a>, the journey from funeral director to owner requires a deep understanding of what ownership entails. It\u2019s easy to look at the rewards of owning a business without fully appreciating the hard work required to reach that level. The climb to the top involves a great deal of learning, adaptation, and a willingness to let go of certain tasks in order to assume the broader responsibilities of ownership.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>When exploring funeral home ownership opportunities, it&#8217;s advisable to memorialize any promises of future ownership in writing with a current owner. Without a formal agreement, there is little foundation to build on, and years of hard work might not result in an ownership stake. Aspiring owners should also be prepared to enhance their leadership and management skills through conferences and training programs, such as those offered by <a href=\"https:\/\/www.johnsonconsulting.com\/services\/jcg-academy\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Johnson Consulting Group\u2019s Leadership and Management Academies<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>One of the current advantages in our profession is the availability of financing. With the right preparation, a bank can fund the purchase of a funeral home, allowing the new owner to pay back a loan over time while keeping the business for themselves. This is a key part of the American dream, but it requires thorough financial readiness, both in terms of savings and skill set. Aspiring owners must be equipped to manage debt and know when and where to seek assistance.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s important to remember that the learning process never stops. As an owner, others will look to you for answers, which can create pressure. But, it\u2019s crucial to continue growing and seeking support when needed.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Looking at the next generation, there\u2019s often a misconception that \u201cThey won\u2019t work as hard as previous generations\u201d. However, today\u2019s business professionals are finding innovative ways to balance work and life. Through outsourcing, leveraging resources like associations and the internet, and using study groups, younger professionals are finding efficient ways to accomplish their goals without overworking themselves. In summary, it\u2019s more about prioritizing balance and using the abundant resources available.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>In conclusion, owning and running a funeral business isn\u2019t for everyone, but it can be incredibly rewarding. The key to success lies in taking care of the families you serve\u2026Period! If you can do that, they will take care of you. With the right preparation, support, and willingness to learn, you can enjoy the many benefits of ownership and establish a successful future for you and your family.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<a href='https:\/\/www.johnsonconsulting.com\/contact-us\/' class='big-button bigblue' target=\"_blank\">Contact us today!<\/a>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>*This article was originally posted on the Funeral Director Daily website.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The funeral profession has long provided avenues for entrepreneurship, and now, more than ever, the opportunities to become your own boss are growing.
