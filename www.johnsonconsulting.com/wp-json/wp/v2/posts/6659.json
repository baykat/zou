With regard to death care, this extra something often refers to emotional attention and care.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The passing of a loved one brings about profound grief and transition for a family. During this time, funeral homes can play a key role in helping families navigate the complex terrain of coping with death.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Naturally, most funeral homes can adequately plan and arrange a memorial service; however, the truly great businesses\u2013\u2013those that create generations of loyalty\u2013\u2013know how to support their families beyond providing tangible goods and services. They go one step further to create <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">happy <\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">families.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What a Happy Family Looks Like<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When planning a service strategy that emphasizes happiness over mere satisfaction, it\u2019s important to remember that every family is different. Because of this, your service strategy should be rooted in attention and individualization.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Some families must navigate the difficult terrain of dividing an estate between heirs, while others are fundraising to cover the cost. Regardless of the circumstances, you\u2019ll want to figure out how to make each family touchpoint speak to these particular needs, providing assistance when possible.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Remember, it\u2019s the \u201cabove and beyond\u201d service that often makes a difference, especially during such a painful time.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How They Help Your Funeral Home<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We\u2019re all familiar with the negative reviews that appear online in the wake of an unsatisfactory service; however, in a similar fashion, truly happy customers can be swayed to share their experience with others and perhaps even through a review online. This is a great way to attract new families as consistent positive reviews increase your rankings on search engines like Google.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Additionally, happy families will likely share their opinions with friends and loved ones. Since funeral arrangements are most often purchased at need, these types of recommendations prove <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.johnsonconsulting.com\/funeral-home-marketing-ideas\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">valuable to funeral homes<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.<\/p>\n<p><\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What a Satisfied Family Looks Like<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Alternatively, a satisfied family will likely remain quiet. While they likely won\u2019t go around town saying negative things about your funeral home, they certainly won\u2019t spread glowing opinions. More importantly, they\u2019ll be less likely to return to your business for their next funeral service, instead opting for a different funeral home.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How They Hinder Your Funeral Home<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While happy families will become loyal to your funeral home and share their experience with other people, satisfied families will do neither of these things. Imagine, for example, a family who recently used your services was asked how they liked your funeral home and their response was, \u201cit was fine.\u201d\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As someone looking to book a <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.johnsonconsulting.com\/increase-your-preneed-sales-with-these-7-tips\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">preneed service<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> or wanting to be prepared for the passing of a loved one, would you choose a funeral home labeled, \u201cfine?\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How to Make Satisfied Families Happy<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Since satisfied families are unlikely to be forthcoming with their opinions, the first step to identifying service issues is to obtain their feedback. One of the best ways to accomplish this is through surveys.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Following the completion of a service, consider reaching out to families through email and request that they complete a survey. Software like <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.j3techsolutions.com\/performance-tracker\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Performance Tracker X\u00a0 by J3Tech Solutions<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> enables you to quickly customize a survey where you can ask about any aspect of your funeral home and obtain valuable input from families.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Once you\u2019ve obtained a substantial amount of survey responses, you\u2019ll inevitably begin to see patterns. Perhaps certain components of your business are leaving guests happy while others leave them underwhelmed. Armed with this information, you can begin to make improvements.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Making Changes<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Regardless of the content of their responses, you should sincerely thank families for taking the time to provide feedback. If a family provides particularly negative feedback about a certain component of your business, you\u2019ll want to go one step further\u2013apologize for the noted deficiencies in your service. You might even articulate the specific efforts you\u2019re taking to correct these shortcomings.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Increase Family Loyalty<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While happy families are generally vocal about their positive experiences, satisfied clients are prone to being taciturn. Even when asked to respond to a survey, their feedback may not provide much clarity. Because of this, consultants are a great way to obtain unbiased feedback about your funeral home\u2019s performance.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.johnsonconsulting.com\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Johnson Consulting Group<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, our team of consultants has decades of experience in the death care industry.
