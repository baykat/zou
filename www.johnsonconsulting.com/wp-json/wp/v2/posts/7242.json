Much like any other component of your funeral home, your staff requires continual investments.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Financial incentives and career growth opportunities can both help engage your employees, but leadership should never overlook the power of positive acknowledgment. Here\u2019s why you should incorporate employee recognition into your performance review meetings.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">1. Greater Employee Satisfaction<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As you might expect, employees appreciate when leadership recognizes their work and achievements; however, many managers underestimate just how much this type of affirmation can mean to their team members.\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to a <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.achievers.com\/press\/achievers-survey-finds-without-recognition-expect-employee-attrition-2018\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">survey from Achievers<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, a majority of employees (69%) value recognition among the top factors they look for in an employer. This surpasses company culture and even opportunities for advancement.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Because of this, leadership should make it a point to continually use performance review meetings as a chance to congratulate and praise the triumphs of their employees. This small action can make a world of difference.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">2. Improve Team Culture<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The leadership of your funeral home sets the tone for your workplace culture. When employees see their leaders conduct themselves in a certain manner, they\u2019ll most often emulate these behaviors.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As such, when leaders make an effort to recognize the achievements of their team, employees will follow suit. The result will be a workplace culture that supports, nurtures, and motivates employees. Rather than compete with one another, team members will honor each other\u2019s achievements and collectively reach for success.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">3. Increase Productivity and Engagement<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">From a logical perspective, employee recognition functions as a form of positive reinforcement. When leadership praises certain behaviors and actions, employees are more likely to continue these behavioral patterns, resulting in increased productivity.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www2.deloitte.com\/ie\/en\/pages\/deloitte-private\/articles\/recognition-programmes.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">research from Deloitte<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, team member engagement, productivity, and performance are 14% higher in organizations that regularly recognize their employees. This same study also found that a 15% increase in engagement can result in a 2% increase in profit margins.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">4. Increase Survey Response Rates<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For leadership teams, it\u2019s essential to solicit feedback from employees, most often as part of the performance review process. However, it can often be difficult for staff members to provide critical feedback to or about their leaders, even if this insight could help improve the workplace.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When team members receive positive feedback, allowing them to see how valued they are in their roles, then they\u2019re more likely to feel emboldened. By empowering employees in this way, leadership can increase the likelihood of receiving positive feedback from employees.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">5. Higher Loyalty and Satisfaction Scores from Families<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to the <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/hbr.org\/2016\/05\/recognizing-employees-is-the-simplest-way-to-improve-morale?zd_source=hrt&amp;zd_campaign=5503&amp;zd_term=chiradeepbasumallick\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Harvard Business Review<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, 40% of workers say they\u2019d put more effort into their work if they received more recognition from their managers. And when team members feel compelled to excel in their roles, they\u2019ll provide improved service.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The logic is simple: happy, productive employees translate to satisfied families.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">6. Increased Retention of Quality Employees<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Recognition of employees can also increase retention. According to a <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.achievers.com\/press\/achievers-survey-finds-without-recognition-expect-employee-attrition-2018\/?zd_source=hrt&amp;zd_campaign=5503&amp;zd_term=chiradeepbasumallick\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">survey conducted by Achievers<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, recognition and rewards were ranked among the most important motivating factors for staying with a company.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This same survey found that, of those looking to switch jobs, 44% of them noted that a lack of recognition and engagement were contributing factors.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Attain a New Level of Employee Success with JCG Consulting<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While the importance of recognizing employees is clear, it\u2019s not always obvious if your employees currently feel valued. To cut through this lack of certainty, your leadership should administer internal surveys that inquire about job satisfaction. The expertise of consultants can help.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At Johnson Consulting Group, our team of <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.johnsonconsulting.com\/services\/business-consulting\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">funeral home business consultants<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> can help you create a strategy for regularly recognizing the work of your employees.
