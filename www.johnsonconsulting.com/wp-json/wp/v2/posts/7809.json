Derrick&#8217;s journey in the funeral service industry is as captivating as it is inspiring. From considering a career in broadcasting to finding his calling in forensics and funeral service, Derrick&#8217;s path is a testament to the power of guidance, passion, and willingness to serve.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">As I have learned over the years in speaking with seasoned funeral service professionals and the Worsham College of Mortuary Science students, I teach the path to funeral service, which has not always been a direct path for many. This is undoubtedly true for Derrick. Derrick&#8217;s journey began with a pivotal conversation with his friend Joe Kalmer, who had transitioned from broadcasting to becoming a funeral director. Joe&#8217;s advice encouraged Derrick to explore trade embalming as a means to fund his forensics degree. This decision led Derrick to Southern Illinois University&#8217;s Mortuary Science Program, where he discovered a profound passion for helping families through their most challenging times.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">As Derrick&#8217;s career unfolded, he became involved with DMORT, a federal mortuary response team under the Department of Health and Human Services. DMORT specializes in assisting with mass fatality events by providing forensic and mortuary expertise. With ten teams across the United States, DMORT deploys when local and state resources are overwhelmed, offering critical support through their Disaster Portable Morgue Units and Victim Identification Centers. Derrick&#8217;s journey with DMORT began after volunteering with the National Funeral Directors Association (NFDA) in New York following the 9\/11 attacks. Encouraged by DMORT members he met there, Derrick applied and underwent a rigorous selection process, including background checks and security clearances, to join the team.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Derrick&#8217;s role as a Mortuary Officer in DMORT requires him to be a licensed Funeral Director, and Embalmer is in good standing. Training is extensive, covering harassment prevention, blood borne pathogen safety, psychological first aid, and more. Annual training sessions, often self funded, prepare team members for various disaster scenarios, ranging from plane crashes to severe weather events.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">During deployments, Derrick&#8217;s adaptability and dedication are evident. Every deployment is unique, with team members like Derrick tasked with diverse assignments\u2014managing morgue operations, conducting forensic examinations, and even participating in reconnaissance missions with military forces. Derrick emphasizes the importance of professionalism and teamwork throughout each deployment, ensuring that every task is executed with precision and care.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Derrick was recently deployed to Asheville, North Carolina, following the devastation of Hurricane Helene. There, he was responsible for managing morgue operations, coordinating with local medical examiners, and strategizing with military search and recovery teams. Despite the challenging conditions, Derrick highlights the deep bonds formed among team members and the resilience of the local community.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">I appreciate that Derrick mentioned the Mercy Chefs organization, which provided warm, nourishing meals to responders and residents. Mercy Chefs is a wonderful non-profit, and I&#8217;ve had the opportunity to volunteer for when floods hit eastern Kentucky. Check them out if you like working in the kitchen and prefer short-term volunteer opportunities. <a href=\"https:\/\/mercychefs.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">www.mercychefs.com<\/a><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">The support provided by DMORT during such crises is crucial for families, offering a semblance of peace by facilitating the identification and release of deceased loved ones. Derrick&#8217;s work, while challenging, strengthens his faith in humanity and the power of compassion during times of tragedy. Learning more about this passion that drives DMORT to help others was genuinely touching.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">The emotional demands of disaster response work are significant. Derrick and his team approach their mission with a steadfast mindset, understanding the critical role they play in facilitating families&#8217; grieving process. Derrick&#8217;s commitment to providing dignified and expedited support is a testament to his dedication and the essential nature of DMORT&#8217;s mission.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">For those inspired by Derrick&#8217;s journey and considering a path in disaster response, Derrick emphasizes the importance of the passion to serve. The work requires mental and physical resilience, adaptability, and an unwavering commitment to the mission. Aspiring DMORT members are encouraged to explore state teams and stay informed about opportunities through platforms like <a href=\"https:\/\/www.usajobs.gov\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">USAJOBS.GOV<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Derrick&#8217;s journey inspires others to embrace the call to serve, highlighting the vital role that DMORT plays in disaster response and the healing process for grieving families. Johnson Consulting Group is proud of Derrick&#8217;s work, which not only aids those in need but also inspires a new generation to follow in his footsteps, serving with dignity and compassion in times of tragedy.<\/p>\n<a href='https:\/\/www.johnsonconsulting.com\/contact-us\/' class='big-button bigblue' target=\"_blank\">Contact JCG Today!<\/a>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Johnson Consulting Conversations: Insider Perspectives and Stories With Lacy Robinson&#8217;s first topic, Funeral Homes and Hospices Working Together<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":20,"featured_media":7810,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"_acf_changed":false,"_et_pb_use_builder":"","_et_pb_old_content":"","_et_gb_content_width":"","inline_featured_image":false,"footnotes":""},"categories":[4,53,106,46,43,44,5,30],"tags":[56,55,69,50,52,63,62,59,60,73,13,14,15,100,104],"class_list":["post-7809","post","type-post","status-publish","format-standard","has-post-thumbnail","hentry","category-blog","category-business-management","category-business-opportunity","category-business-tips","category-customer-experience","category-financial-management","category-jcg-art","category-qa","tag-customer-experience","tag-financial-advice","tag-funeral-homes","tag-jcg","tag-jcgcares","tag-johnsonconsultinggroup","tag-organize-financials","tag-performance-tracker","tag-sales","tag-workwithjcg","tag-funeral-business-management-consulting","tag-funeral-business-valuations","tag-funeral-home-accounting","tag-growth","tag-staff-performance"],"acf":[],"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO Premium plugin v21.0 (Yoast SEO v24.3) -
