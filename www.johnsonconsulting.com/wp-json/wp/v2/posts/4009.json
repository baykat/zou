They were our Veterans but our fellow citizens first. For so many of those who served and gave their lives, due to the years of waiting, the surviving members of their family may have not had a close family connection or even an introduction. In some cases, there was only extended family who would receive their loved ones remains. With one soldier, his set of dog tags is all that was recovered.\u00a0 The tags were presented to the soldier\u2019s son who shared that the memory of his father was when he was just three years old. Nevertheless, the established relationships were not the only motivation of hearts, but the fact that they lived, they served and they were family.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2>THE IMPORTANCE OF RETURNED REMAINS<\/h2>\n<p>There is an innate sense of emptiness and angst, when a person is presumed dead, yet there is no evidence. Early in the grief of these soldier\u2019s families, at best, there was hope of life or at the worst, hope in the recovery their precious loved one\u2019s body or remains. Proof of death is seeing some remaining presence of the life lived and is a critical element that contributes to healing. Grief for a time screams in disbelief. Consider the agony of the soldier\u2019s loved ones never really knowing or for some, knowing, but unable to see.<\/p>\n<p>The value of having these soldier\u2019s remains returned reaches beyond their own family members. So many like myself, feel the relief and complete knowing that these families will have the comfort to have the remaining evidence of life and finally lay their loved ones to rest. Finally, there will be a place of remembrance, a sacred site, from which to pay honor and reflect.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2>PROVIDING\u00a0CLOSURE<\/h2>\n<p>When listening to the news, I often hear journalists and reporters use the term <em>\u201cclosure\u201d<\/em> when referencing the families of the Korean Veterans. In exercises with Funeral Directors, I discourage that term when speaking with families, as it is so early in their journey of healing. When the term <em>closure<\/em> is introduced in the arrangement, it often implies and is perceived, that the door is shut and with it, their loved one\u2019s memory is over. This is an inaccurate reference and instead, I encourage the professionals to use a statement such as:<\/p>\n<h5 style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"color: #7da1c4;\"> \u201cThese ceremonies will be one step in your journey and provide a satisfying sense of comfort.\u201d<\/span><\/h5>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignleft size-medium wp-image-4012\" src=\"https:\/\/www.johnsonconsulting.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/09\/ben-hendricks-621069-unsplash-450x602.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"224\" height=\"300\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.johnsonconsulting.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/09\/ben-hendricks-621069-unsplash-450x602.jpg 450w, https:\/\/www.johnsonconsulting.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/09\/ben-hendricks-621069-unsplash-768x1028.jpg 768w, https:\/\/www.johnsonconsulting.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/09\/ben-hendricks-621069-unsplash-700x937.jpg 700w, https:\/\/www.johnsonconsulting.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/09\/ben-hendricks-621069-unsplash-1920x2571.jpg 1920w, https:\/\/www.johnsonconsulting.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/09\/ben-hendricks-621069-unsplash-250x335.jpg 250w, https:\/\/www.johnsonconsulting.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/09\/ben-hendricks-621069-unsplash-120x161.jpg 120w, https:\/\/www.johnsonconsulting.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/09\/ben-hendricks-621069-unsplash-512x685.jpg 512w, https:\/\/www.johnsonconsulting.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/09\/ben-hendricks-621069-unsplash-336x450.jpg 336w, https:\/\/www.johnsonconsulting.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/09\/ben-hendricks-621069-unsplash.jpg 1936w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 224px) 100vw, 224px\" \/>Regarding the Veterans who have been returned for their final rest, it is more understandably referenced, as providing a sense of <em>closure<\/em>. The <em>closure<\/em> in this regard is that the final step in the journey, when someone dies, is complete. Final rest is just as it infers; it is the final place of rest for that loved one\u2019s remains. There is a completion in the journey when families make final rest plans when their loved one dies.<img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-4013 alignright\" src=\"https:\/\/www.johnsonconsulting.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/09\/mark-duffel-482873-unsplash-450x591.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"228\" height=\"300\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.johnsonconsulting.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/09\/mark-duffel-482873-unsplash-450x591.jpg 450w, https:\/\/www.johnsonconsulting.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/09\/mark-duffel-482873-unsplash-768x1009.jpg 768w, https:\/\/www.johnsonconsulting.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/09\/mark-duffel-482873-unsplash-700x919.jpg 700w, https:\/\/www.johnsonconsulting.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/09\/mark-duffel-482873-unsplash-1920x2521.jpg 1920w, https:\/\/www.johnsonconsulting.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/09\/mark-duffel-482873-unsplash-250x328.jpg 250w, https:\/\/www.johnsonconsulting.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/09\/mark-duffel-482873-unsplash-120x158.jpg 120w, https:\/\/www.johnsonconsulting.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/09\/mark-duffel-482873-unsplash-512x672.jpg 512w, https:\/\/www.johnsonconsulting.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/09\/mark-duffel-482873-unsplash-343x450.jpg 343w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 228px) 100vw, 228px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>This brings me to an encouragement, and for some an admonition, as it regards final rest. Families who choose cremation are often deprived counsel of the benefits which final rest provides. Because it is stated by the Federal Trade Commission that cremation is a form of, \u201cfinal disposition\u201d, often funeral professionals do not explain the options or advise a family that eventually it is recommended, and most preferable, to establish a place of final rest for their deceased loved one who has been cremated. Certainly, the businesses that have cemetery and funeral home combinations are suited for and are more conscientious to direct families in selecting a place of final rest such as niche, earth burial, and scattering in an ossuary or a garden and memorialized on a cenotaph, etc. However, consistently it has been my experience, that funeral professionals neglect to advise and direct families in the value of establishing a final resting place, even if is long into the future.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2>\u00a0Personal Reflection<\/h2>\n<p>In September of 2017, my mother died. We planned a time of gathering with her present, followed by a very personalized ceremony and a lavish reception. After all the events, she was cremated. For a time, I had the presence of my mother, in her urn, in our living room, waiting the day that we would travel to her final rest. It was her wish to be buried where she grew up in Wyoming, resting among family members with the rich presence of memories and love.<\/p>\n<p>In June of 2018, we carried her remains in a one-of-a-kind, personalized urn and laid her to rest beneath the mountains in her home community. Once the graveside ceremony in all its grandeur and personalization was complete, we placed her in the urn vault along with fresh flowers and individual sentiment. Only at that point was I overcome with a comforting sense of satisfaction and completion. I would not say I had a sense of <em>closure<\/em> as it has been less than a year since her passing and memories are fresh. I do, however, have a comforting sense of satisfaction and completion that everything that we could do, and in my conviction, should do for her, was done.<img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignleft size-medium wp-image-4010\" src=\"https:\/\/www.johnsonconsulting.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/09\/grave-1605706_1920-450x338.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.johnsonconsulting.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/09\/grave-1605706_1920-450x338.jpg 450w, https:\/\/www.johnsonconsulting.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/09\/grave-1605706_1920-768x576.jpg 768w, https:\/\/www.johnsonconsulting.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/09\/grave-1605706_1920-700x525.jpg 700w, https:\/\/www.johnsonconsulting.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/09\/grave-1605706_1920.jpg 1920w, https:\/\/www.johnsonconsulting.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/09\/grave-1605706_1920-250x188.jpg 250w, https:\/\/www.johnsonconsulting.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/09\/grave-1605706_1920-120x90.jpg 120w, https:\/\/www.johnsonconsulting.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/09\/grave-1605706_1920-512x384.jpg 512w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>From a family perspective, providing counsel of final rest and options after cremation, is extremely valuable and in time, will bare great appreciation. From a business standpoint, it increases the value of the consultation and the options provided by the funeral professional, as well as potential increase in the contract. In terms of an arrangement, whether at-need or pre-need, I would say the only appropriate consideration to <em>closure<\/em>, would be if ceremony and final rest were discussed and it was determined which of the options will provide the family a comforting sense of satisfaction in the memory of their loved one.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>These principles and additional skills are featured in our on-line video training C.A.R.E.Ring C.A.R.E.munication\u00ae, our single, premier training tool that affects the Performance Tracker and Customer Satisfaction Survey! \u00a0For more information and a complete description <a href=\"https:\/\/www.johnsonconsulting.com\/funeral-home-training-online-training\/\">click here<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h4><strong>Melanie Loyd<\/strong><br \/>\n<span style=\"color: #7da1c4;\"><em>Owner of In it for Life, LLC<br \/>\nAuthor and Presenter of C.A.R.E Ring Communication<\/em><\/span><\/h4>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignleft size-medium wp-image-4014\" src=\"https:\/\/www.johnsonconsulting.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/09\/Melanie-Loyd-450x585.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"231\" height=\"300\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.johnsonconsulting.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/09\/Melanie-Loyd-450x585.jpg 450w, https:\/\/www.johnsonconsulting.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/09\/Melanie-Loyd-768x998.jpg 768w, https:\/\/www.johnsonconsulting.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/09\/Melanie-Loyd-700x910.jpg 700w, https:\/\/www.johnsonconsulting.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/09\/Melanie-Loyd-1920x2496.jpg 1920w, https:\/\/www.johnsonconsulting.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/09\/Melanie-Loyd-250x325.jpg 250w, https:\/\/www.johnsonconsulting.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/09\/Melanie-Loyd-120x156.jpg 120w, https:\/\/www.johnsonconsulting.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/09\/Melanie-Loyd-512x666.jpg 512w, https:\/\/www.johnsonconsulting.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/09\/Melanie-Loyd-346x450.jpg 346w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 231px) 100vw, 231px\" \/>Licensed in Kansas and Oklahoma, Melanie Loyd presently coaches and equips funeral professionals on location, in the classroom and on web conferences in the US and Canada. \u00a0Author and presenter of, C.A.R.E.Ring, C.A.R.E.
