McComb and the DW McComb Group on its recent acquisition of Inman Shipping Worldwide, the nation\u2019s foremost international shipping service, serving funeral directors through the United States, Great Britain, the Caribbean and beyond.<\/p>\n<p>DW McComb Group is a newly formed holding company which will oversee and manage a number of subsidiary companies focused on serving the funeral service profession on a global basis, including Inman Shipping Worldwide. <\/p>\n<p>\u201cAs a leader and pioneer within its segment, Inman Shipping Worldwide is an ideal fit for the DW McComb Group,\u201d said Jake Johnson of Johnson Consulting Group. \u201cDavid has built his career by serving his fellow man, which is how Robert and Marilyn built their business over the past 35-plus years. We are honored to have played an integral part in bringing these two great names in funeral service together.\u201d  <\/p>\n<p>David W. McComb is a licensed funeral director and fourth-generation co-owner of D.O. McComb &#038; Sons Funeral Homes, a family of seven funeral homes managing 1,500+ calls per year in Fort Wayne, Indiana. In addition to serving as the CEO of the DW McComb Group, David McComb is a successful entrepreneur and investor, including holdings covering a wide range of products, services and segments within the funeral service profession, including pre-need planning software, online obituaries and logistics.<\/p>\n<p>With its network of superior embalming specialists and patented air shipping container, Inman Shipping Worldwide has been \u2013 and will continue to be \u2013 an innovative leader in funeral service shipping. With its acquisition of Inman Shipping Worldwide, DW McComb Group can now offer a full spectrum of shipping and logistics services to funeral directors on a global scale.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWhen working with buyers and sellers in acquisitions like this one, it\u2019s as much a  blending of corporate cultures and individual personalities as it is arriving at a mutually acceptable dollar figure,\u201d explains Tom Johnson, chairman of JCG. We\u2019ve worked hard to earn our reputation and position in the death care industry not by just making deals, but by creating long term successful mergers where each side emerges successfully, both on the short term and the long term.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThe team at JCG was instrumental in making this acquisition possible,\u201d added David McComb. \u201cIt was a long, thorough process, and their expertise, insights and service were invaluable. Indeed, Tom Johnson\u2019s knowledge of the businesses, and his personal relationships with the various individuals made this deal come together.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>For additional information about the Johnson Consulting Group\u2019s services in the US and Canada, visit www.johnsonconsultinggroupinc.com or call 888-250-7747.  <\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE SCOTTSDALE, Arizona, May [19], 2014 \u2013 Phoenix, AZ \u2013 Johnson Consulting Group, the death care industry leader in mergers and acquisitions, worked closely with David W.
