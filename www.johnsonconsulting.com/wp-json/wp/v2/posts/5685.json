The stars are aligned for both buyers and sellers, and Jake Johnson (President and CEO of the Johnson Consulting Group) talks about why the odds favor both sides of the table in the latest episode of his \u201cM&amp;A Minute\u201d video series.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2>Why You Should Buy Now<\/h2>\n<p>There are a multitude of decisions to make when buying a business, and finding the right loan\/ financing option can sometimes make or break the deal. One of the factors that make this a buyer\u2019s market are the favorable lending programs currently offered by the Small Business Administration (SBA). The SBA helps small business owners get guaranteed loans which can be used for most business purposes and feature unique benefits such as competitive rates, lower down payments and flexible overhead requirements.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>The agency recently updated their policies to provide more benefits for borrowers and lenders. Funeral home and cemetery professionals looking to grow or expand their business should take advantage of the SBA\u2019s generous terms, which include reduced or no fees as well as government subsidy payments up to three months\u2019 worth of principal and interest for new loans. It\u2019s important to move quickly however, as some of these loan provisions are temporary and will expire on September 30, 2021. \u201cThese programs won\u2019t last forever so if you pass them up, you\u2019re passing up free money to grow your business,\u201d says Johnson.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2>Right Now Money is Cheap<\/h2>\n<p>Interest rates continue to be low, which is a great incentive for funeral home and cemetery owners ready to invest in their business. Since borrowing is cheap right now \u201cYou can afford more business with a lower payment than in high interest years,\u201d says Johnson. This is the time to make improvements, buy equipment, expand into new locations, or even sell your business. Low rates often stimulate buyer demand, which can lead to more and better offers for business owners ready to sell.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Whether you\u2019re a seller or a buyer, it never hurts to work with a business broker to achieve your goals.
