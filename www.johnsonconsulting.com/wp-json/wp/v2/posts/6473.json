Your grounds, entryway, and other aspects of interior design have the power to convey the professionalism and care of your services. Conversely, outdated or unkempt interiors can immediately turn off prospective clients.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Because of this, it\u2019s essential to pay close attention to the aesthetics of your funeral home. Not only should families feel comfortable in your funeral home, but they should also sense that everything is kept up to date.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With that said, <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.johnsonconsulting.com\/ma-minute-recap-episode-17\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">keeping an updated space<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> doesn\u2019t have to cost tens of thousands of dollars. If your funeral business is in need of some touch-ups, here are some simple updates you can make without breaking the bank.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">1. Change Out Your Light Fixtures<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Do you still have that early 90\u2019s brass chandelier in the front entry? What about your bathrooms and entryway\u2013\u2013are they still lit by unseemly fluorescent bulbs? A quick and easy update for any funeral home is to replace your lighting fixtures and bulbs.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For larger lighting fixtures, natural materials and minimal designs are growing in popularity, and many stylish options can be purchased from stores like Ikea for under $200. In terms of bulbs, most businesses are switching from harsh fluorescent lighting to LED bulbs. Not only do LED lights cast a softer glow, but they\u2019ll also last a lot longer than fluorescent options.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">2. Hang New Curtains<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Another quick fix that won\u2019t cost too much is your curtains. Gone are the days of dark and heavy fabrics. Nowadays, most people prefer neutral and light-colored shades. You could even consider sheer or translucent fabrics that let more light into your space. At a store like Target, you can find plenty of stylish and durable curtains for about $100 per pair.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Also, be sure that your curtains reach your floor. This is a great way to draw the eye up and create the illusion of higher ceilings, even in smaller spaces.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">3. Replace Flooring<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In funeral homes, there\u2019s room for all types of flooring; however, if your current floors are filled with scuffs, dinginess, or\u2013\u2013worst of all\u2013\u2013holes, then it might be time to refresh these surfaces.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Some options to consider:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li aria-level=\"1\"><b>Carpet: <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Warm, cozy, and slip-resistant, carpets are an ideal option for many funeral homes. Additionally, prices for carpeting run pretty cheaply. The main downside of carpets is the maintenance required. To keep them clean and free of allergens you\u2019ll want to regularly vacuum and shampoo them.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<ul>\n<li aria-level=\"1\"><b>Vinyl: <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Low-maintenance, water-resistant, and highly affordable, vinyl is a great flooring option that comes in a variety of styles\u2013\u2013some of which even emulate wood or tile. Vinyl flooring is also easy to install.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<ul>\n<li aria-level=\"1\"><b>Laminate: <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Similar to vinyl, laminate flooring is an affordable option that mimics the appearance of more expensive flooring types. Affordable, easy to install, and stain-resistant, laminate is a great choice for high-traffic areas. The main downside with laminate is that many varieties of this flooring can appear cheap.<\/span><\/li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\"><b>Wood: <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Since hardwood floors are by far the most expensive option, we don\u2019t recommend laying down new wood, at least for budget renovations. That said, if your funeral home already has wood floors, then you might consider giving them a touch-up. By cleaning wood floors, removing an existing stain, and applying a fresh topcoat, you can make old wooden floors look brand new.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">4. Install Fixtures<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Your bathroom, kitchen, and doors can get a quick facelift by simply replacing faucets, knobs, paper towel racks, and other small fixtures. Recently, fixtures with antique brass or brushed nickel finishes have grown in popularity. Whichever variety you choose, just be sure to maintain consistency. When replacing doorknobs, for example, you don\u2019t want to forget to include matching hinges.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">5. Upgrade Your Walls<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Similar to upgrading your floors, another way to transform your space is to give your walls a facelift. For starters, you could consider repainting to a tasteful neutral color. As with curtains, bright and neutral colors are the best options that will appeal to the widest range of people. Whether you do it yourself or hire a professional, painting is relatively cheap, <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.forbes.com\/advisor\/home-improvement\/cost-to-paint-a-room\/#:~:text=It%20costs%20an%20average%20of,your%20geographic%20location%20and%20more.\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">costing under $4 per square foot<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Alternatively, with wallpaper once again being in style, you could consider adding wallpaper to certain areas. You could even try a peel and stick option for easier application and removal. While you won\u2019t want to overdo it with wallpaper, covering every room with patterns, adding accent walls in select areas like the bathroom can go a long way.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">6. Refresh or Create a New Gathering Space<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Whether it be a kitchen or other extra room, it\u2019s very useful for funeral homes to have a space for families to gather before and after a service. While the size and furnishing of these spaces vary widely, you\u2019ll want to take a closer look at how you can keep them updated and comfortable.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If this space is a kitchen, consider replacing linoleum countertops with laminate or granite. Cabinets could be repainted and knobs replaced with more current designs. If the space is more of a lounge, then you could consider replacing sofas and tables with more minimal furnishings, ones with neutral color palettes.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Make the Right Changes<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If all of these changes sound stressful, then it might sound appealing to consider the services of an interior designer. However, not only are design fees costly, but you\u2019ll need to find a person who has expertise with what today\u2019s family is looking for.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This is where you can turn to the professionals at Johnson Consulting Group.
