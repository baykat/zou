Two of these business\u00a0management tools are demographic analysis and\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.pragmaticinstitute.com\/resources\/articles\/product\/the-fundamentals-of-revenue-forecasting\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">revenue forecasting<\/a>. These tools of analysis provide an\u00a0idea of where you are regarding marketplace position\u00a0and strategy, and where you are going in terms of total\u00a0contract revenue.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2>So, what is demographic analysis?<\/h2>\n<p>Demographic analysis, at its core, helps businesses\u00a0understand their place in the market by understanding\u00a0market potential. Marketplace is one of the four\u00a0fundamental areas of focus for successful funeral home\u00a0businesses, along with customer service, workplace and\u00a0finances. Improving your firm\u2019s position in the marketplace\u00a0though strategies such as advertising, business\u00a0promotion, marketing plans or active pre-need\u00a0programs starts with fully understanding the market\u00a0itself. Demographic analysis helps us understand\u00a0current and future demand for funeral home services\u00a0by gaining insight on population composition, distribution\u00a0and overall marketplace trends.<\/p>\n<p>Many independent funeral home owners have a strong\u00a0sense of the demographic trends in their area because\u00a0of their long-term relationships with the communities\u00a0they serve. Four, five or six generations of service\u00a0in town certainly provides a good perspective of the\u00a0marketplace trends of the area. Yet the best business\u00a0decisions leverage concrete data alongside these solid\u00a0ground-level perspectives. This is where a thorough demographic analysis can pay dividends in your\u00a0marketplace strategy decisions.<\/p>\n<p>For example, we dissect a map of concentric rings\u00a0extending 10 miles out from the place of business.\u00a0Further analysis helps us know important data in\u00a0the marketplace within each of these rings, such as\u00a0population trends, how many people are in the 65+\u00a0age group and changes in median household income.\u00a0Generally, the 10-mile radius gives us a clear picture for\u00a0most funeral home markets, but this must be tailored\u00a0to a firm\u2019s specific market.<\/p>\n<p>Demographic trends can influence the market death\u00a0rate and a funeral home\u2019s market share. These important\u00a0metrics can and should impact marketing strategies\u00a0and advertising budgets. We use demographic\u00a0analysis to understand the historical and current size\u00a0of the marketplace \u201cpie\u201d and the recent trends help us\u00a0understand what the future may look like. All of this\u00a0information can be employed to strengthen a funeral\u00a0home\u2019s position in the marketplace and increase their\u00a0market share.<\/p>\n<p>Firms can use the information derived from demographic\u00a0analysis to implement marketing strategies and\u00a0improve the strategies they have. Knowledge of local\u00a0demographic data can have specific applications such\u00a0as search engine optimization (SEO) strategy, setting\u00a0parameters for digital marketing campaigns or targeted\u00a0community involvement programs. This data improves\u00a0the precision of these initiatives and helps firms gain\u00a0the most for their spend.<\/p>\n<p>Ultimately, demographic analysis helps funeral home\u00a0businesses make better decisions in improving their\u00a0marketplace position so every dollar spent is a dollar\u00a0spent wisely.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2>How revenue forecasting helps you prepare\u00a0for the unexpected<\/h2>\n<p>In the uncertain times we\u2019ve experienced recently, a\u00a0clear financial picture has become even more important\u00a0for managing expenses and maintaining cash flow.<\/p>\n<p>For many businesses, in any given year, an annual operating\u00a0budget acts as a guide for financial decision-making\u00a0throughout the fiscal year. It is a financial plan that\u00a0can be consistently referenced throughout the year to\u00a0keep business expenses on target.<\/p>\n<p>But COVID-19 has changed our business rapidly.<\/p>\n<p>Drastic shifts in case mix, average sale by case type and\u00a0overall volume can leave anyone wondering what the\u00a0future looks like.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3>How has COVID-19 affected budgets?<\/h3>\n<p>In budgeting for a funeral home business, case mix\u00a0tends to have marginal and fairly predictable changes\u00a0year over year. Furthermore, average sale by case type\u00a0can be accurately budgeted through careful sales analysis\u00a0and pricing adjustments. One of the many challenges\u00a0independent funeral home owners are experiencing\u00a0with COVID-19 is the drastic shift in case mix due to\u00a0regulations on gatherings and the preferences of families.\u00a0Even average sale by case type has varied greatly\u00a0from budgeted amounts. Beyond all of this, some firms\u00a0are seeing a decrease in call volume while others are\u00a0experiencing nearly double their monthly budgeted call\u00a0volume. In the end, the annual funeral home budget for\u00a02020 has become a much less accurate measuring stick\u00a0due to the coronavirus pandemic.<\/p>\n<p>Revenue forecasting is a way of taking some of the\u00a0uncertainty out of the financial management equation.<\/p>\n<p>As a fundamental of a successful funeral home business,\u00a0financial management requires timely financial\u00a0statements and an accurate picture of cash flow. But\u00a0the recent turbulence in case mix, average sale and case\u00a0volume may leave many independent funeral home\u00a0owners wondering what next month\u2019s profit and loss\u00a0statement will look like. Revenue forecasting utilizes\u00a0micro-periods of recent sales data to project future\u00a0funeral home revenue. By using assumptions based on\u00a0recent evidence, revenue forecasting models can generate\u00a0projections of revenue when certain variables are\u00a0expected to change or stay constant.<\/p>\n<p>Revenue forecasting can complement a traditional funeral home budget by providing snapshots of different scenarios. If the exercise is done monthly, revenue projections will converge toward the actual total revenue for the year as the projection window narrows. In the case of COVID-19, this tool allows firms to see year-end revenue projections based on the drastic changes to business experienced in recent months. By calculating variances to the company\u2019s original budget, precise\u00a0expense reductions can be implemented to ensure\u00a0cashflow and operating profit remain healthy. Revenue\u00a0forecasting paired with the annual funeral home budget\u00a0takes much of the guesswork out of expense reduction\u00a0and overall financial management.<\/p>\n<p>Revenue forecasting requires detailed sales contract\u00a0analysis software so that case mix, average sale and case\u00a0volume can be analyzed for specific time periods. These\u00a0variables must be understood to produce an accurate\u00a0revenue forecast. Funeral home businesses benefit\u00a0greatly from the ability to monitor this data monthly.\u00a0But it is the ability to leverage this data for financial\u00a0decisions where the true value lies \u2013 especially in times\u00a0of business disruption. Revenue forecasting is a prime\u00a0example of leveraging detailed sales contract analysis\u00a0data for specific financial decisions.<\/p>\n<p>In a year such as this one, the tools of demographic\u00a0analysis and revenue forecasting \u2014 while vastly different\u00a0\u2014 can help you make the smartest decisions for\u00a0your business and successfully lead it into its next\u00a0chapter.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><em>This article was originally published in the Fall 2020 issue of\u00a0The Independent.\u00a0<\/em><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">Have questions or want to learn more? <a href=\"https:\/\/www.johnsonconsulting.com\/contact-us\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Contact the JCG team today!\u00a0<\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The value of demographic analysis and revenue forecasting in market positioning and financial management &nbsp; Like many industries this year, funeral service is in flux.\u00a0COVID-19 has impacted the profession in ways that\u00a0may permanently alter the way business is conducted.
