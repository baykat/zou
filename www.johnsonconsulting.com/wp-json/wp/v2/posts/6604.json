Increased value also means more financial gain when it\u2019s time to sell.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here are some surefire ways to increase the value of your funeral business.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">1. Get an Annual Valuation<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Often seen as a requisite step for selling a funeral home, valuations should actually be performed every year. Doing this will not only simplify your taxes, but will also form the foundation of your strategic planning. By obtaining a professional <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.johnsonconsulting.com\/5-reasons-why-you-should-get-a-business-valuation-every-year\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">funeral home valuation<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u2013\u2013as opposed to relying on estimates or gut feelings\u2013\u2013you can begin to determine where your business stands in relation to your goals and how to best move forward.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How It Helps Improve Your Funeral Home\u2019s Value<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While a valuation doesn\u2019t inherently improve the value of your funeral home, it provides you the clarity you need to grow your business. If you plan to expand your business, for example, a valuation will also be necessary to attract investors and financing.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">By obtaining a yearly professional valuation, you can track your progress over time and make sure that you&#8217;re reaching your goals.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">2. Conduct an Annual SWOT Analysis<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In addition to learning the value of your funeral home, you\u2019ll also want to <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.johnsonconsulting.com\/neglecting-a-swot-analysis-dont-do-it-heres-why\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">conduct an annual SWOT analysis<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> before implementing strategic changes. To conduct a SWOT analysis, you\u2019ll have to consider each of these as they apply to your business:<\/span><br \/>\n<b><\/b><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li aria-level=\"1\"><b>Strengths: <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Areas in which your funeral home currently excels.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<ul>\n<li aria-level=\"1\"><b>Weaknesses: <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Aspects of your business that stand to grow or improve.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<ul>\n<li aria-level=\"1\"><b>Opportunities: <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Factors, internal and external, that could cause your business to grow.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<ul>\n<li aria-level=\"1\"><b>Threats: <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Factors, internal and external, that could harm your business.<\/span><\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How It Helps Improve Your Funeral Home\u2019s Value<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">By conducting a thorough SWOT analysis, your funeral home can better understand its current performance and how this stands to change over time\u2013\u2013both positively and negatively. When performed properly, this type of examination can help you seize opportunities and mitigate risks\u00a0 while maintaining optimal performance.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">3. Implement Incentive Compensation Plans<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.johnsonconsulting.com\/4-components-incentive-compensation-plan\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Incentive compensation plans<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> tie an employee\u2019s earnings to products sold, the success of their team, or the overall success of the business. In the death care business, this could take several forms, including:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Offering commission based on each sale.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Providing a bonus for soliciting a certain percentage of feedback from families.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Providing company-wide raises when revenue goals are met.<\/span><\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How It Helps Improve Your Funeral Home\u2019s Value<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Even the most driven employees can benefit from some extra motivation, and this is the core ideology behind incentive compensation. By rewarding the performance of your employees, you\u2019ll not only encourage behavior that boosts your bottom line, but you\u2019ll also increase their workplace satisfaction.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Moreover, when it comes time to sell your funeral home, having a high-performing team will make your business a more compelling buy.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">4. Create Clear and Concise Cash Flow Reports<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Carefully tracking <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.johnsonconsulting.com\/how-to-combat-common-cash-flow-issues\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">cash movement<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> through your business is a crucial performance indicator. That\u2019s why it\u2019s important to create accurate budgets, organize your financial statements through an accounting system, and potentially hire a dedicated accountant.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How It Helps Improve Your Funeral Home\u2019s Value<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Diligent cash flow management provides you the clarity you need to keep your funeral home profitable. By understanding each of your business\u2019s cash inflows and outflows, you can more effectively monitor changes and fluctuations in your financial picture.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This becomes even more important when planning to sell as a disorganized financial picture is a surefire way to turn off interested buyers.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">5. Build Community Partnerships<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Like fire departments or public schools, funeral homes provide an essential service to the communities they serve. That\u2019s why it\u2019s important to <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.johnsonconsulting.com\/funeral-home-strategies-partnerships\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">develop partnerships<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> with other businesses. Not only does this help get your name out there, but it also enshrines a degree of trust with families.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How It Helps Improve Your Funeral Home\u2019s Value<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Community partnerships help your bottom line in two main ways. Transactional partnerships\u2013\u2013for example, with a local florist or crematorium\u2013\u2013allow you to secure mutually beneficial deals on frequently needed services. Alternatively, there are less formal partnerships that serve to enhance your funeral home\u2019s reach. Leading a workshop at a senior care community or hosting a fundraiser with a local Lions chapter will boost your reputation and inform your community of the services you offer.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">6. Focus on Preneed Sales<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you haven\u2019t developed an effective preneed strategy for your funeral home, then now is the time to start. By training your employees to sell pre-arranged services, you can develop a sales funnel that positively impacts your business both in the present and future.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How It Helps Improve Your Funeral Home\u2019s Value\u00a0<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.johnsonconsulting.com\/preneed-impacts-value\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Preneed impacts value<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> because it demonstrates the market share of your funeral home. A fleshed-out portfolio of preneed sales indicates that your funeral home will have continued business down the line, and it also speaks to the efficacy of your sales team\u2013\u2013both of which make your funeral home a more appealing purchase.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">7. Hire Funeral Home Experts<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Naturally, every funeral director wants to maximize the value of their business; however, achieving this is neither simple nor linear. Making matters more difficult, you can\u2019t lose touch with the day-to-day tasks of running your funeral home. If you\u2019re unsure of how to most effectively boost the value of your funeral home, then it might be best to call in some expert help.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How It Helps Improve Your Funeral Home\u2019s Value<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A skilled funeral home consultant can holistically examine each aspect of your business, from employees and services to your greater positioning in the death care industry. From this observation, they can suggest strategic initiatives and even provide you with the scaffolding to achieve them.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.johnsonconsulting.com\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Johnson Consulting Group<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, our team of death care consultants has experience owning, operating, and selling funeral homes of all sizes.
