While everybody appreciates updated facilities and fair pricing, the people you employ offer families emotional support that create lasting loyalty.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And unlike embalming or sales strategies, compassion is nearly impossible to teach. Because of this, finding and <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">retaining the best people<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> will ultimately determine the success of your funeral home.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here\u2019s how to do it right.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Recruiting Top Talent<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To find the best talent in the death care industry, you can look to resources both internal and external. By leveraging job boards, word-of-mouth, and funeral-specific recruiting tactics, you can find the right people to make a positive impact on your funeral home. It goes with saying that people like to do business with companies they like and trust, the same goes for employees and the company they work for. Make your business the workplace of choice and you&#8217;ll find that recruiting top talent can get easier.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Employee Referrals<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One of the best places to start your search for candidates is by asking your team for referrals. In many cases, good employees will know good people, and employee referrals <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.apollotechnical.com\/employee-referral-statistics\/#:~:text=Employee%20Referrals%20Show%20A%20Higher%20Conversion%20Rate,-Job%20applicants%20who&amp;text=Employee%20referrals%20increase%20the%20likelihood,for%20more%20than%20four%20years.\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">tend to stick around longer<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> than those found externally.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Facebook and LinkedIn Industry Groups<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On social media networks like Facebook and LinkedIn, you can find groups of industry-specific talent. For example, the group \u201cFuneral Employment Source\u201d has thousands of members actively looking for death care work.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Job Boards<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While we\u2019re all familiar with the likes of Indeed and ZipRecruiter\u2013\u2013viable options in themselves, you might also consider looking at job boards specific to the death care industry. The <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/funeralcareers.nfda.org\/jobs?locale=en&amp;page=1&amp;sort=relevance&amp;country=&amp;state=&amp;city=&amp;zip=&amp;latitude=&amp;longitude=&amp;keywords=&amp;city_state_zip=\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">NFDA\u2019s jobs page<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> allows you to post openings to their audience of death care professionals<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Funeral Service Recruiters<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To offset some of the work on your part, you might turn to a funeral service job recruiter. For example, <strong>Akre &amp; Associates<\/strong><\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> as well as <strong>Global Recruiters Batesville<\/strong> can help match you with a funeral professional that suits your immediate needs.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Mortuary Schools<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Particularly when looking for young talent, your local mortuary school can be a great place to find passionate individuals looking to begin their careers in death care.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Internal Development Programs<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you\u2019re having trouble filling skilled roles at your funeral home, you might also look to your current pool of talent. With proper training and succession planning, you can help current employees upskill and add value to your business.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Retaining Top Talent<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As a general rule, you should <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.johnsonconsulting.com\/5-ways-to-keep-quality-talent-in-your-funeral-home\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">aim to retain 90%<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> of your employees. Failure to meet this threshold will not only be costly\u2013\u2013in terms of working to fill vacant roles\u2013\u2013but it may also indicate that your funeral home\u2019s work culture isn\u2019t meeting the needs of team members.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To make sure your talent sticks around, consider the following:<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Frequent Recognition<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When team members excel in their roles, it\u2019s important for leadership to take the time to recognize this. Doing so not only demonstrates your appreciation for their hard work but also motivates other team members to comport themselves in a similar fashion.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Consistent Staff Accountability<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Conversely, when a team member underperforms, leadership should hold them accountable. Of course, you won\u2019t want to call them out in front of the rest of the team, but you\u2019ll want to take steps to understand what caused a team member to perform poorly and provide them with the guidance to prevent it from happening in the future. There is a saying that goes, <em>there is no greater unequal than the unequal treatment of unequals<\/em>.\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><a href=\"https:\/\/www.johnsonconsulting.com\/services\/business-consulting\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Incentive Compensation Plans<\/span><\/a><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While verbal recognition certainly helps spur team members to perform their best, incentive compensation has a similar effect. By implementing a system through which regular bonuses are tied to employee performance\u2013\u2013for example, sales or positive family feedback\u2013\u2013you add some extra motivation for optimal performance. In today&#8217;s competitive environment for pay, incentive compensation plans can provide extra compensation to employees tied to the success of the business.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Team Member Development (Employee Success Plans)<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">During interviews, employers often ask the question: <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Where do you see yourself in five years?<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Once employed, team members will be asking themselves a similar question, and if they don\u2019t see themselves growing and evolving with your funeral home, this will create issues of turnover.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Because of this, you\u2019ll want to actively work with team members to chart out a plan for them within your business, providing them with opportunities to earn greater pay and acquire new skills.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Employee Satisfaction Surveys<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In many cases, team members will be hesitant to raise concerns about their work conditions. By administering anonymous employee satisfaction surveys, you can obtain valuable information about how to better your funeral home and its culture.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Role of Customer Experience in Talent Management<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Delivering an exceptional customer experience isn\u2019t just vital for families\u2013\u2013it\u2019s also a critical factor in attracting and retaining top talent. A funeral home with a strong reputation for compassionate service and care is more likely to appeal to professionals who take pride in their work and seek an environment that aligns with their values. When your team knows that their efforts directly contribute to meaningful, lasting impressions on families, it fosters a sense of purpose and satisfaction. This, in turn, creates a positive cycle: a motivated team enhances the customer experience, which reinforces your funeral home\u2019s reputation and helps draw more skilled and passionate professionals to your business. To reinforce this it&#8217;s critical to implement a customer satisfaction program like <a href=\"https:\/\/www.johnsonconsulting.com\/services\/performance-tracker-x\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">JCG&#8217;s Performance Tracker X program<\/a>.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Why a Funeral Home Consultant is Crucial<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As the director or owner of a funeral home, it can be difficult to get a clear picture of how your team members view their roles. Team members will often treat leadership with a degree of deference, telling them what they <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">want <\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">to hear as opposed to what they <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">need <\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">to hear. Often, dissatisfied (yet high-performing) employees will keep their opinions to themselves and seek work elsewhere. To get the valuable insight you need regarding your work culture, you\u2019ll want to turn to some outside help.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The team at <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.johnsonconsulting.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Johnson Consulting Group<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, one of the nation\u2019s largest death care consulting firms, has the skills required to help funeral homes examine their operating performance and implement strategic improvements.
