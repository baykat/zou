In addition to the expected capital gains taxes, you\u2019ll also have to consider how your real estate and income play into the equation.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Especially if you\u2019ve been in business for many years, you\u2019ll want to pay close attention to both local and federal regulations. To ensure a successful sale of your funeral business\u2013\u2013with no surprises from the IRS\u2013\u2013you need to be prepared.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here\u2019s what to consider:<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Capital Gains<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When you sell your funeral business, you\u2019ll first want to consider the capital gains tax. This tax is levied on the profits made from any type of investment when the investment is sold. Often, this tax applies to the sale of stocks; however, it also applies to businesses and real estate. The rates for this tax are 0%, 15%, or 20%, depending upon the bracket of the taxpayer during the year of sale.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Because funeral homes tend to stay around much longer than other businesses\u2013\u2013sometimes over one hundred years\u2013\u2013the capital gains can be significant. This potentially puts funeral home and cemetery professionals at a greater tax risk than others, as they\u2019ll likely report significant totals of capital gains.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For example, if you purchase a funeral home for $300,000 and sell it 20 years later for $1 million, then you stand to owe $140,000 in capital gains taxes, depending on your income, losses, and other factors. The key here is to speak to an accountant before the sale so that you can anticipate these taxes. A common <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.johnsonconsulting.com\/regrets-selling-funeral-home\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">regret of funeral home owners<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is neglecting capital gains and being shocked at the totals they owe to the IRS.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Depreciation Recapture Tax<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Unlike other businesses, funeral homes also almost always include real estate, which must also be taken into account during the sale of your business. In particular, you\u2019ll want to <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.johnsonconsulting.com\/funeral-home-taxes\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">consider the depreciation recapture tax<\/span><\/a><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Traditionally, funeral and cemetery businesses account for wear and tear on their facilities and equipment by deducting a percentage of the asset\u2019s value each year. However, upon the sale of your facilities and equipment, the IRS will collect taxes on any profitable sale of these assets that you\u2019d previously used to offset taxable income. The depreciation recapture is taxed at the ordinary income tax rate up to a certain threshold percentage, which could mean well over $500K-$1M in additional taxes.\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To begin understanding how this will affect you at the time of sale, consider the cost basis of your assets. The initial cost basis is the amount you paid for the asset. The adjusted cost basis will be the initial one minus any depreciation expenses that occurred. For depreciation recapture tax purposes, you\u2019ll be taxed on any amount of sale greater than the adjusted cost basis. Again, the key is to remain aware of the tax deductions you\u2019ve used over the years.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Income Taxes<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Oftentimes, ordinary income taxes have an even greater impact than capital gains taxes. This is because, for most individuals, the capital gains tax rate will be about 15%. However, the income tax rate can be as high as 37% for income over $523,600.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This is why it\u2019s a particularly good idea to explore a potential sale now, as both capital gains and income tax rates are likely to increase in the coming years. In the wake of the pandemic, valuations are also higher for funeral businesses, making now an ideal time to consider putting your funeral business on the market.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Trust Funeral Profession Experts<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The process of selling your funeral business has a lot of moving parts. In addition to considering all of the issues of tax compliance, you\u2019ll also have to obtain a solid valuation, find the right buyer, and broker the eventual deal\u2013\u2013not to mention the day-to-day operations of your funeral home. Unless you&#8217;re an expert in both tax code and business brokerage, you\u2019ll likely want to enlist the help of an expert team.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.johnsonconsulting.com\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Johnson Consulting Group<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is the all-in-one package offering all the expertise you need in one place.
