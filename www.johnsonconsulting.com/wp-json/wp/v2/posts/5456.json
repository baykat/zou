This report helps us do that.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The Performance Tracker Trends and Insights: 2020 COVID-19 Impact presents results received as of Sept. 30, 2020 from the 2020 <a href=\"https:\/\/www.getperformancetracker.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Performance Tracker<\/a> sales and family satisfaction survey. The analysis contextualizes the effects of COVID-19 pandemic within the funeral service profession and the ways clients are reacting to restrictions on funeral services.<\/p>\n<p>Key findings include:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>As the pandemic continued through the summer and into fall, families were less likely to recommend their funeral home to others, often citing a comparison such as \u201cit wasn\u2019t as good as previous experience\u201d with a focus on or problem with costs, or the way services were handled as a result of Covid-19 restrictions.\n<ul>\n<li style=\"list-style-type: none;\">\n<ul>\n<li>Families indicated lower levels of satisfaction than in 2019 across every attribute for burials, most notably with the initial contact and with staff.<\/li>\n<li>\u201cDespite the circumstances\u201d became a popular refrain as family satisfaction ratings fell in 2020.<\/li>\n<li>In the second quarter of 2020, families reported much lower levels of satisfaction, in particular, for traditional at-need cremations.<\/li>\n<li>Family satisfaction levels for pre-need, graveside or immediate burial arrangements, already lower in 2019 than traditional burials, dropped and remained well below previous ratings.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<li>Families that were unable to have the services they wanted often opted for lower cost direct or immediate alternatives.<\/li>\n<li>The average sale per case at $4,079 in April 2020 is 16 pecent lower than the $4,881 average in 2019.<\/li>\n<li>In the 3rd quarter, families paid approximately $500 more for monuments, regardless of whether their service was a burial or cremation. Casket and cemetery sales were higher for both case types, as were alternative containers for burials.<\/li>\n<li>Discounts in 2020 were lower overall than were reported in 2019; however, reported discount amounts increased as the year progressed.<\/li>\n<li>The limitations of a provider\u2019s technology became a point of dissatisfaction as a single negative experience with a single staff member or even one element not working as intended was often enough to generate a reaction: \u201cEverything was perfect, except my experience with [some technology failure].\u201d\n<ul>\n<li style=\"list-style-type: none;\">\n<ul>\n<li>Issues with technology, live streams, recordings, , displays and other features often added to an \u201calready stressful experience of trying to coordinate a funeral during a pandemic.\u201d<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Lori Salberg, Director of Technology at Johnson Consulting Group\u2019s sister company, J3Tech Solutions states, \u201cCOVID-19 presented particular challenges for businesses behind the technology curve.
