All of that brings into play a much bigger digital footprint left after death.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>You may have personally experienced the challenges in managing a loved one\u2019s online accounts and social media profiles following their death.\u00a0 As a funeral service professional you have most likely witnessed the frustration family members feel in accessing their loved one\u2019s important information.\u00a0 It can be overwhelming and confusing for those family members in charge of handling their loved one\u2019s estate.\u00a0 The complicated nature of handling one\u2019s personal affairs can certainly lead to identity theft and or extending probate court for years. There are tremendous opportunities for funeral directors and pre-arrangement specialists to assist individuals in completing their digital estate plan that includes instructions for handling digital property and assets.<\/p>\n<p><strong>\u00a0<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>A funeral director or pre-arrangement specialist can introduce digital legacy planning to families during the at-need arrangement conference, pre-arrangement conference, aftercare meetings, and as a community outreach program.\u00a0 Below are 11 ideas to consider for implementation.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>Create a new position or role\/title called Digital Legacy Advisor.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>A Digital Legacy Advisor provides important information, the necessary resources and step-by-step guidance to help clients complete their digital legacy plan.
