Here are 5 Things You Need To Know"},"content":{"rendered":"<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Selling a funeral business is one of the most exciting times for an owner; however, it is a complex process that requires a great deal of thought and planning.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To ensure the success of the sale, there are a number of factors to consider. From setting realistic expectations to finding the right outside help, selling your funeral business is a difficult act to pull off, but if you do it right, you can guarantee that the sale sets you up for success \u2013 whether this means retirement or moving on to your next venture.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In this guide, we\u2019ll review all the steps an owner must take from start to finish when selling a business.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Planning is Crucial<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Before you start the sale process, it is important to plan ahead. Take the time to understand your business\u2019s current financial health, market position, and future prospects.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Beyond this, you\u2019ll also want to consider what your goals are with the sale. Are you hoping to exit a lifetime of work and retire in Florida, or are you hoping to sell the business and remain on the team in some capacity?<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">By planning out what your ultimate aim is, you can begin to figure out when you might sell, for how much, and to whom.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Set Realistic Goals<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As you plan, it\u2019s important to outline realistic goals. Naturally, every owner wants to sell their funeral home for the maximum price in the shortest amount of time, but this may not always be possible, depending on the state of your business and the greater market conditions.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Unlike real estate, in which homes may sell within a day of hitting the market, the death care industry is more specialized. Not just anyone can buy a funeral business, and among those individuals buying, not everyone is qualified.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">By being realistic about the timeline of your sale, as well as your business\u2019s asking price, you can prevent <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.johnsonconsulting.com\/regrets-selling-funeral-home\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">settling for less than you\u2019re worth<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Valuation Package or Marketing Package?<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Getting a valuation is the best way to internally understand where improvement opportunities exist for creating value.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A business valuation is an internal product and should not be shared with a potential buyer. Why? A business valuation will have a more conservative review with payroll, marketing, and other expenses that will be adjusted differently and more aggressively under a marketing package.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The sole purpose of a marketing package is to show the opportunity, minimize the risk, and create value in the business that may not exist today. For this reason, marketing packages are invaluable for business owners who are<\/span> <a href=\"https:\/\/www.johnsonconsulting.com\/when-is-it-the-right-time-to-put-my-funeral-home-for-sale\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">ready to sell NOW<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Time to Create a Marketing Package<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As you begin the process of selling your business, you\u2019ll need to get a professional marketing package created. Not only are marketing packages critical for any qualified buyer to review, but they also can give you an accurate picture of how much money you should ask for.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If the value from the marketing package doesn\u2019t end up where you want it, then it may be best to hold off selling until you can make proper adjustments to your operations. At Johnson Consulting Group, we can help you <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.johnsonconsulting.com\/ive-gotten-a-valuation-now-what\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">create a post-valuation plan<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to improve your enterprise value.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Understand Tax Implications<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When selling a funeral business, it\u2019s essential to understand the entire picture of tax implications. Particularly for those who plan to retire after a sale, it\u2019s imperative that you account for the potentially large taxes that follow a sale. Otherwise, you might have an unpleasant surprise come tax season.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In most cases, it\u2019s best to seek some outside help. A consultant who specializes in the funeral industry can help your tax accountant and attorney best minimize your tax burden.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Buyers Matter<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.johnsonconsulting.com\/finding-a-business-buyer\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Finding the right buyer<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> for your business can be a challenging process, one that will ultimately depend on the current state of the market as well as your ability to leverage your network. In most cases, an ideal buyer will be one already affiliated with the funeral services profession.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The funeral profession is a small network and many of the buyers are known. How you engage with those buyers depends on a well-constructed marketing package, confidentiality, and a timely process. This will ensure your success to maximize your value.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You may already have a buyer in mind, and that buyer would hope you would only talk to them. There are few buyers, if any, that would want to work with you indirectly through a broker. This is because they know they will have to pay more for the business. Ironically, all buyers would agree that a process that includes a broker is more organized, flows better, and is more timely to a close.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In summary, to maximize value, more than one buyer needs to be involved and it must be a structured process. Keep in mind that the highest price may not come from the buyer you thought would pay the most. At Johnson Consulting, we like to have 7-10 buyers involved in each marketing package. We are continually surprised by who the ultimate buyer is, as opposed to who we thought the buyer would be.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Work With Industry Experts<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Selling a business is a complex process, the success of which will drastically impact your next steps in business and life. It\u2019s essential to seek the outside expertise needed to execute a sale right. It\u2019s surprising to see business owners who commonly use a real estate agent to sell their home, but not using an expert to sell the most valuable asset they own \u2014 which is their funeral business.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If the industry expert does their job, they will increase the value which will accomplish two things: put extra money in the owner\u2019s pocket and pay for the consultant without infringing on the value the owner receives.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At Johnson Consulting Group, our team of death care professionals can help you through every step of the process, from obtaining a valuation, finding a buyer, and brokering an eventual sale. With our collective decades of experience in the field, our consultants, accountants, and brokers can help you plan an exit strategy from the ground up, aligning your goals with the potential of your business.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It all starts by partnering with us. By conducting a holistic examination of your funeral home, we can help you determine where your business currently stands and what needs to be done before a sale. <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.johnsonconsulting.com\/contact-us\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Reach out today<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to schedule a consultation.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href='https:\/\/www.johnsonconsulting.com\/contact-us\/' class='small-button smallblue'>GET IN TOUCH TODAY<\/a><\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Selling a funeral business is one of the most exciting times for an owner; however, it is a complex process that requires a great deal of thought and planning. <\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":22,"featured_media":7340,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"_acf_changed":false,"_et_pb_use_builder":"","_et_pb_old_content":"","_et_gb_content_width":"","inline_featured_image":false,"footnotes":""},"categories":[4,46,42,1],"tags":[54,49,61],"class_list":["post-7335","post","type-post","status-publish","format-standard","has-post-thumbnail","hentry","category-blog","category-business-tips","category-sell-my-business","category-uncategorized","tag-business-consulting","tag-business-tips","tag-sell-my-business"],"acf":[],"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO Premium plugin v21.0 (Yoast SEO v24.3) - https:\/\/yoast.com\/wordpress\/plugins\/seo\/ -->\n<title>Thinking About Selling This Upcoming Year?
