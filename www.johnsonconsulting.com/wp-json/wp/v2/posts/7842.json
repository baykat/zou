With the decline of local newspapers and rising publication costs, funeral directors have been searching for more effective ways to announce deaths and celebrate lives. Bob shared how this challenge led to the creation of ObituaryShare, a platform designed to address these modern concerns while respecting traditional funeral service values.<\/p>\n<p class=\"Body\">&#8220;The decline in newspaper circulation wasn&#8217;t just about reduced readership,&#8221; Bob explained. &#8220;It meant families were paying more for less exposure, often receiving outdated news in return.&#8221; This reality sparked the need for a digital solution that could provide a broader reach while maintaining the dignity and importance of death notices.<\/p>\n<p class=\"Body\">What makes ObituaryShare unique is its development team&#8217;s diverse background \u2013 combining the expertise of a field director, a newspaper veteran, a school teacher, and a social media expert. This varied perspective ensured the platform would be both practical for funeral directors and accessible to families. The goal was simple: enhance existing services without adding complexity to funeral directors&#8217; already demanding schedules.<\/p>\n<p class=\"Body\">The results have been remarkable. Funeral homes using the platform have reported a 74% increase in flower sales and a 19.2% rise in pre-need policy size. The increase in website engagement is even more telling, with average visit duration jumping from 42 seconds to 1.6 minutes, and users exploring more pages per visit.<\/p>\n<p class=\"Body\">One of the most innovative aspects of ObituaryShare is its ability to target specific community groups. Bob shared an example of how an obituary for Jimmy Cruz was strategically promoted to relevant groups, including tire dealers, Boy Scouts, realtors, and bankers \u2013 communities that were meaningful to the deceased but might have been missed through traditional channels. The platform&#8217;s success lies in its understanding that Facebook alone isn&#8217;t sufficient for comprehensive obituary sharing. The social media giant&#8217;s algorithms often limit organic reach, necessitating a multi-platform approach to ensure maximum visibility.<\/p>\n<p class=\"Body\">The adoption of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.johnsonconsulting.com\/funeral-home-website-needs\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">funeral home digital solutions<\/a> has led to significant business improvements. Funeral homes using ObituaryShare have reported an 8% growth in market share over the past five years, along with increased average revenue per call. The platform has proven particularly effective in reaching key demographics, with 68% of users being females over 55 \u2013 a crucial audience for funeral services.<\/p>\n<p class=\"Body\">As the funeral profession continues to evolve, the balance between tradition and innovation becomes increasingly important. Bob emphasized that embracing technology doesn&#8217;t mean abandoning traditional values. Instead, it means enhancing our ability to serve families more effectively. The rise in cremation and memorial services suggests that families are looking for more personalized ways to honor their loved ones, and digital platforms are helping funeral homes meet these changing needs.<\/p>\n<p class=\"Body\">For funeral directors considering digital solutions, Bob&#8217;s advice is straightforward: give it a try. ObituaryShare offers a no-commitment trial period, allowing funeral homes to experience the benefits firsthand without long-term contracts or setup fees. The platform has been designed to integrate seamlessly with existing operations, making the transition to digital as smooth as possible.<\/p>\n<p class=\"Body\">The conversation with Bob Arrington highlighted an important truth about funeral service: while the tools we use may change, our core mission of serving families remains constant. By embracing <a href=\"https:\/\/www.johnsonconsulting.com\/funeral-home-marketing-ideas\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">funeral home digital innovation<\/a>, funeral homes can extend their reach, improve their service offerings, and better support families during their time of need. The future of funeral service lies in finding the perfect balance between traditional values and modern solutions, and platforms like ObituaryShare are helping to bridge that gap.<\/p>\n<p class=\"Body\">Would you like to learn more about how digital solutions can enhance your funeral home&#8217;s services?
