Whether you sell the business or bequeath it to your child, it\u2019s important to begin planning your exit strategy as soon as possible to ensure a smooth transition.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Before even taking the reins of ownership, you should begin charting your business lifecycle, one that guides you from purchase through operation, growth, and the eventual sale. While no plan can account for absolutely everything, having a rough guideline will help you make strategic decisions along the way. Most importantly, it puts each of your actions in perspective.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Buying<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When planning to purchase a funeral home, it\u2019s tempting first to consider the region; however, just because a funeral home is nearby does not mean that it\u2019s a good fit for you. Apart from the location, facilities, and equipment, you\u2019ll want to consider where the funeral home currently stands. This includes its employees, market positioning, and current financials.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Remember, buying a funeral home includes inheriting its current business structure, and while a fledgling business might be a savvy investment\u2013\u2013depending on your experience level\u2013\u2013it will also require more work to turn it around. Again, the key is to plan strategically.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Funeral Home Business Plan<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In any industry, purchasing a business requires careful consideration of budgets, staffing, and growth initiatives. In addition to these concerns, the death care industry comes with the challenge of serving populations in times of emotional duress. Because of this, customer service should be at the forefront of your <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.johnsonconsulting.com\/funeral-home-business-plan\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">funeral home business plan<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Take the time to focus on every family touchpoint\u2013\u2013from initial call to after care\u2013\u2013and determine how you can optimize the client experience. Undoubtedly, this issue will bring staffing into question. You\u2019ll want to take stock of existing employees, their roles, and their skillsets, ultimately determining where to make changes to better serve families.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Another vital component of your business plan will be your financial management. In tandem with plans for growth, you\u2019ll need to develop a system to accurately track and report both profits and losses. The best option here is to hire an <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.johnsonconsulting.com\/services\/accounting-financial-management\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">accountant with funeral-specific experience<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. A skilled death care bookkeeper can not only track your financial performance but also provide suggestions related to pricing and planning.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Growth<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To succeed in your <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.johnsonconsulting.com\/how-to-succeed-in-your-first-year-of-owning-a-funeral-home\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">first year of owning a funeral home<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, you\u2019ll want to start with human connections. First and foremost, this means reaching out to the families who have booked services with your funeral home. Consider sending them a handwritten letter in which you announce your new role as the director and your commitment to continuing to provide the exceptional service they\u2019ve received in the past.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You should take the time to understand how each team member performs. Consider hosting an introductory meeting where you introduce yourself and clearly articulate your values as a funeral director. Once you\u2019ve learned a bit more about how this team performs, you can assess where additional training is needed.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To sustain growth through your first year and beyond, here are some additional areas to focus on.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Conduct Surveys<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Look to patrons to learn more about the funeral home. They can likely provide valuable insight related to pain points and how to improve them.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For example, by sending a feedback survey to former families who have used your funeral home\u2019s services, you can learn what parts of your funeral home excel and which stand to be improved.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Since a large portion of your staff and facilities will likely be the same, many prior problems will still exist. By soliciting feedback, you can better determine where to focus your improvement efforts.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Expand Your Preneed Services<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A surefire way to increase your bottom line is through the <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.johnsonconsulting.com\/increase-your-preneed-sales-with-these-7-tips\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">expansion of preneed services<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Often, many families are not aware that they can book funeral arrangements in advance, so one facet of this expansion will be raising awareness as part of your after care program.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Start by educating your staff on how to sell these services and begin to set goals each month. This is a great way to add value to your funeral home.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Diversify Revenue Streams<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With the rates of traditional burial on the decline and alternative arrangements growing in popularity, there has never been a better time to invest in multiple ways to honor the deceased. Building a cremation facility or contracting with a local crematorium is one way to keep up with these trends.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Alternatively, if you don\u2019t want to spend so much on capital improvements, you might consider offering keepsakes or alternative celebration services. These will allow you to supplement any fluctuations of revenue from traditional burials.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Create Strategic Partnerships<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While relationships with employees and families are the most important when it comes to running a funeral home, building <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.johnsonconsulting.com\/funeral-home-strategies-partnerships\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">community partnerships<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> can also be a boon to your business.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Partnering with local florists and cemeteries can secure you favorable pricing for services, while informal partnerships with other organizations\u2013\u2013hospice centers, police forces, and Lions Clubs\u2013\u2013can help ingratiate your funeral home as part of the community and keep you top of mind when families are in need.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Valuation<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While it might sound counterintuitive, after your first year, you should start looking into the value of your funeral home and start planning for an exit strategy. Even if you plan to run it for several decades, it\u2019s good to <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.johnsonconsulting.com\/5-reasons-why-you-should-get-a-business-valuation-every-year\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">conduct a valuation every year<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, as it provides valuable insight related to your progress and growth.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While you can perform an in-house valuation on your own, the most reliable measures involve hiring an independent professional familiar with the funeral space. By assessing your funeral home\u2019s cash flow, risks, and potential growth, a professional valuation will give you the most realistic idea of your business\u2019s worth and aid with tax concerns.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Knowing When to Sell<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Regardless of what you anticipate in terms of timing your exit, there may come a time when selling your funeral home makes the most sense. For example, as we emerge from the pandemic, and in-person gatherings are once again feasible, many funeral homes have seen a spike in their value, making now an optimal time to sell.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Alternatively, if you receive a low valuation, you can take adequate measures to ensure you reach your goal numbers by the time you wish to sell your business. This is why it\u2019s important to evaluate your funeral home with regularity. A valuation functions as a tangible metric of your funeral home\u2019s progress.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Exit<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When the time comes, and you\u2019re ready to exit your funeral home, you\u2019ll have two main options:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Handing over directorial duties while maintaining ownership<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Selling your business and moving on to other ventures<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While passing on your funeral home to a relative is certainly an option, it\u2019s important to make sure you treat this as a formal sale, rather than a gift. As you\u2019ve undoubtedly learned, running a funeral home is no easy task, and a child\u2019s passion for the industry doesn\u2019t necessarily translate into business acumen. There\u2019s a reason that a vast majority of family businesses <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.johnson.cornell.edu\/smith-family-business-initiative-at-cornell\/resources\/family-business-facts\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">don\u2019t make it past the second generation<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If Selling Your Funeral Home<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When selling your funeral home, you\u2019ll first want to consider the market conditions. This applies to not only the funeral industry but also tax concerns. For example, taxes on capital gains are currently low; however, if they were to rise, then selling your funeral home might become less profitable.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You\u2019ll also want to do some research on the multiples being paid for other funeral homes. A metric of a company\u2019s financial wellbeing, multiples will give you greater insight into what price your business might sell for.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Then you should consider the situation in terms of buyers. Despite the pandemic, there is currently a large pool of buyers for funeral homes, including large corporations, regional buyers, and private, independent buyers. In most cases, an entity will use financing to purchase your business, so interest rates will also impact your ability to sell your funeral home.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Finding a Buyer<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While a dedicated funeral home broker will be an indispensable resource for finding qualified buyers, there are also some steps you can take to avoid wasting your time.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When screening buyers, you\u2019ll want to look for:<\/span><b><\/b><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li aria-level=\"1\"><b>Demonstrable interest in the funeral business. <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A reliable indicator of this is years of experience working in death care industry roles. If a buyer already has certifications related to death care and mortician practices, then they\u2019re likely a qualified candidate. Ideally, candidates will have owned funeral homes, crematoriums, or cemeteries.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Access to funds.<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> All the experience and passion won\u2019t matter if a person can\u2019t afford your business. Make sure your buyer is already pre-approved by a lender. If a person doesn\u2019t plan to finance the purchase of your business, then you\u2019ll want to verify bank statements.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Additionally, it\u2019s important to remember your role as the seller. In the same way, you\u2019ll want buyers to come ready with financial and work information, you\u2019ll also need to provide detailed records of your business&#8217;s value, revenue, and taxes. Otherwise, qualified buyers won\u2019t be willing to risk a purchase.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Support at Every Step<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Whether you\u2019re looking to purchase your first funeral home, or you\u2019re planning for an eventual sale, <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.johnsonconsulting.com\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Johnson Consulting Group<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> can help guide you through every stage of your funeral business\u2019s lifecycle.
