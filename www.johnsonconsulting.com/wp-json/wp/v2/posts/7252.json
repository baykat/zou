Naturally, a significant component of performance management meetings will be constructive feedback; however, managers should also focus on several additional elements.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">By taking the time to not only critique employees but also listen to them, engage them, and create collaborative goals, leaders can ensure that performance management meetings become a cornerstone of their management strategy.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">1. Preparation<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Before entering a performance review meeting, managers should examine an employee\u2019s previous performance reviews. Within these reviews, you\u2019ll find a comprehensive look at an employee\u2019s strengths, weaknesses, successes, and drawbacks, as well as their goals for the future.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">During the impending review, managers should use prior reviews in order to contextualize an employee\u2019s current performance. For example, suppose a prior review indicated that a funeral director aimed to improve their satisfaction rating from families. You can use this information in the new review to understand whether or not they achieved this goal.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">2. Reflection<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On the employee\u2019s end, employees should be asked to review themselves before engaging in a formal review. In this type of self-evaluation, an employee will return to their prior reviews, take a look at the goals they\u2019d set for themselves, and assess how they performed.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">During the present review, managers should refer to these self-evaluations as the foundation of discussion. When an employee notes that they\u2019ve reached a goal, leadership can applaud them, as well as discuss what actions the employee took to achieve said result. Alternatively, if an employee acknowledges that they\u2019ve failed to achieve a goal, a manager can discuss how this can be improved in the future, setting goals accordingly.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">3. Active Listening<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ultimately, the goal of any performance review is to better understand how team members work, how they currently excel, and how they stand to grow. Because of this, managers need to create an atmosphere of empathy and trust.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Employees should not fear that admitting to a shortcoming will result in their termination or demotion; rather, they should trust that their manager listens to their experience. If team members feel comfortable expressing their weaknesses honestly, then managers can help them practice new skills to overcome any relevant obstacles. Growth mapping in this manner is one of the best ways to <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.johnsonconsulting.com\/employee-engagement\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">engage employees<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">4. Transparency<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Honest communication is crucial to any performance review, and this is just as important for both the employee and the manager. Both participants should speak honestly about the employee\u2019s performance. This provides the basis for discussion.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If a manager feels that a team member could perform more effectively, they should state this, albeit compassionately. In response to this honest feedback, an employee may agree, disagree, or even ask clarifying questions. Ideally, at the end of the review, an employee and manager are on the same page in terms of current performance and subsequent steps.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">5. Goal-Setting<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Based on the collaborative assessment of an employee, both an employee and manager can work together to create goals for the upcoming year. In most cases, an employee will need several sets of goals that play to their current strengths and challenge them to work on their shortcomings.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">By articulating these goals in a formal manner, managers can realign with their team members and ensure that they\u2019re on the same page with company-wide goals.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">6. Action<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">No goal is complete without accompanying actions and KPIs (Key Performance Indicator). If an employee aims to increase their preneed sales, then they will need to settle on a tangible number of sales within a certain timeframe.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For goals that are more difficult to measure\u2013\u2013for example, refining one\u2019s leadership practice\u2013\u2013managers might consider <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.johnsonconsulting.com\/why-its-so-important-to-keep-learning-in-funeral-service\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">career development opportunities<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, calling on outside assistance to boost the skill sets of their teams.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Develop your Team with JCG Academy<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While many death care skills, particularly those for younger employees, can be learned on the job from senior team members, employees with more experience should still be given opportunities to grow.
