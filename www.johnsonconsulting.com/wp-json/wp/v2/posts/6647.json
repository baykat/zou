Here&#8217;s Your Ultimate Checklist"},"content":{"rendered":"<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">More than your manicured grounds and updated facilities, your employees are what drive the success of your funeral home. Embalmers, managers, and funeral directors are the keystones of your business, and they ultimately dictate its day-to-day operations, particularly as they relate to families.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It goes without saying that you\u2019d want the most skilled, personable, and accommodating staff. Here\u2019s how to successfully recruit for these positions.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Prepare a Compensation Package<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Before you begin the recruiting process, you\u2019ll want to develop a detailed compensation package for the roles you wish to fill. While you likely won\u2019t discuss compensation during the initial recruitment phases, you\u2019ll want to be able to provide a ballpark range for salaries. This way, candidates will know immediately if your opportunity is worth their time.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Additionally, you might consider planning out the other components of your compensation package. These might include healthcare, paid time off, and <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.johnsonconsulting.com\/4-components-incentive-compensation-plan\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">incentive compensation structures<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. By offering benefits beyond a salary range, you can further entice people to consider joining your team.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Create a Job Description<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In writing your job description, you\u2019ll want to think about exactly what you\u2019re looking for in candidates and articulate this clearly. This way, prospects will get a clear picture of what the job entails, which skills are required, and what their life will look like as part of your team.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In a job description, you\u2019ll want to include:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Job responsibilities<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Desired experience<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Required skills or certifications<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Characteristics of the ideal candidate<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A salary range<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Additionally, you\u2019ll also want to include some information about your work culture. This is where you can mention benefits, the size of your team, and your company vision. All of this serves to entice qualified candidates to apply.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Use Numerous Recruiting Methods<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Rather than posting a job on your website or through Facebook, you\u2019ll want to use more targeted means of recruiting. For starters, you should post your job listing on death care industry sources like the NFDA and job boards of local mortuary schools. Additionally, you can consider more general employment websites such as LinkedIn, Monster, Indeed, and ZipRecruiter.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Your goal should be to broaden your pool of candidates, giving you plenty of options to choose from.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Additionally, if you have the space to do so, you might also consider reaching out to your local network of death care professionals. Particularly when looking for young talent, mortuary programs, and business schools can be a great place to find passionate individuals looking for new opportunities.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Involve Your Employees<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A big mistake many funeral homes (and businesses) make during hiring is leaving employees out of the process. While you naturally can\u2019t involve your team in every step, you might consider seeking their input.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For example, during the initial phases of recruitment, you might ask your team what they\u2019d look for in a leader or what skills and abilities they feel are missing in the current operational procedure. Additionally, when you\u2019ve narrowed down your candidates to two or three options, you might invite these people to meet with your employees. During this time, your employees can ask any questions on their minds and get a better feel for potential candidates.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Involving your current employees allows them to get a better sense of how a person might fit within your work culture. It will also inform candidates of how effectively they might work with your team.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Be Open to Change<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Just because a person fits with your work culture doesn\u2019t mean they won\u2019t have ideas of their own. Some of these ideas might drastically change the ways in which your team operates. Embrace this!<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Assuming you\u2019ve done your due diligence and found an exceptional candidate with both passion and expertise for death care, you should trust in your new hire to make changes as they see fit. Particularly if you\u2019re hiring a new funeral director, you\u2019ll want this person to be able to put their stamp on the business. This will ultimately ensure their (and your) success.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Don\u2019t Settle<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When looking for someone to run your funeral home, the last thing you want is to settle for a candidate who you\u2019re not confident in. Handing the keys to someone lacking in experience, skill, or drive can quickly work to tarnish the business you\u2019ve worked so hard to build, and recovering from such a blow is no easy feat. Because of this, it\u2019s often best to turn to the experts in funeral profession hiring.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The team at Johnson Consulting Group has one of the largest national networks of death care professionals. In addition to their consulting services\u2013\u2013which will provide insight into the type of leader you need\u2013\u2013their recruiting services can help connect you with qualified candidates that exceed the expectations of your job description.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In many cases, recruiting can become a full-time job, one that distracts from the immediate business of running your funeral home. At JCG, we can take the load off your shoulders and begin matching you with the best candidates in the business. <\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>More than your manicured grounds and updated facilities, your employees are what drive the success of your funeral home.
