Naturally, this starts with the purchase (or creation of) a funeral home and ultimately concludes with an exit.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Failure to create an exit strategy in advance can lead to an unwieldy and financially risky transition. That\u2019s why, as you plan for growth, you should simultaneously sketch out the basics of their departure.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Knowing It\u2019s Time<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There may never be a <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">right time<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to exit your funeral business. In fact, throughout one\u2019s trajectory, there will likely come several times during which an exit makes sense. The key here is to recognize when these moments occur.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Often, market conditions create optimal occasions for an exit. Perhaps, over the course of a decade, you\u2019ve grown your business, you\u2019ve received a high valuation, and the market is favorable. In these cases\u2013\u2013even if you have yet to reach retirement age\u2013\u2013an exit might make financial sense, particularly if you wish to cede leadership duties while still owning the business.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Alternatively, many find it\u2019s time to exit for personal reasons. Perhaps you\u2019ve felt burnt out in your role and this job no longer satisfies you in the way it once did. Or maybe you\u2019ve reached an age where leading an entire team has become difficult, and retirement seems like the logical next step.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Whether your motives are financially or personally rooted\u2013\u2013in most cases, both will come into play\u2013\u2013you\u2019ll want to recognize that an exit is on your horizon, allowing you to act accordingly.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Having an Exit Strategy<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ideally, you should have a rough idea of your exit strategy as soon as you begin operating your funeral home. It\u2019s never too early to start <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.johnsonconsulting.com\/plan-your-exit-strategy\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">planning your exit<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. This way, when ideal conditions arise, you can quickly put your plan into motion.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To prepare your exit strategy, you\u2019ll want to consider the following:<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Your career goals\u00a0<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Exiting your business does not necessarily mean selling it. As you plan your exit strategy, you should consider where you want your career to go. Are you hoping to exit the industry altogether, expand, or perhaps retire? Each of these options will drastically change your approach to an exit.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Your personal finances<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ideally, your funeral home has experienced consistent growth, allowing your exit (or sale) to provide you with optimal financial returns. Regardless, you\u2019ll want to chart out your greater financial goals and examine how exiting your funeral home fits into these plans.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Your succession<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Whether you plan to pass your business down to a relative or sell it to another proprietor, you\u2019ll want to develop a plan for succession. This will allow your funeral home to continue to thrive, even if you\u2019re no longer a part of it.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Two Options<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While no two exits look exactly the same, we can break them down into two different categories:<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Maintaining ownership<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In many cases, it makes more sense to maintain ownership of your business while handing off directorial responsibilities. This option allows you to continue profiting from the business you\u2019ve created while scaling back responsibilities.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With this option, however, it\u2019s essential to take the necessary steps to train your successor. Whether they\u2019re a family member or external hire, a new owner will need extensive initial support to properly take the reins of leadership.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Selling your funeral home<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The more final option, <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.johnsonconsulting.com\/funeral-home-mistakes\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">selling your funeral home<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, is often preferable for those seeking retirement or a total exit from the industry. This option, however, is heavily contingent on the market conditions. Selling your funeral home at the wrong time can result in significant losses while timing it properly can give you the capital gains to fund retirement.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Make the Right Choices<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When contemplating an exit from your funeral business, the question is not one of <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">if <\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">but rather <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">when<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.
