Cemetery businesses will be able to view and compare their monthly and Year to Date (YTD) statistics, including their total versus budgeted calls, as well as sales and sales averages through the sales summary report. They will also be able to view their average sales per case type by budgeted and actual amounts. The sales summary report will also detail YTD statistics of burial, cremation, calls, overall sales and averages. Businesses will be able to view their top arranges by name, sales average and number of cases.<\/p>\n<p>Cemetery businesses will also be automatically alerted of their survey summary statistics. The survey summary details the YTD number of surveys received versus the number of surveys sent. Businesses will be notified upon receiving negative scores, perfect scores, personal stories or a new lead. Leads will be broken out into headstones and markers, bereavement, community events, prearranged funeral or cremation services, additional cemetery spaces and other variations.<\/p>\n<p>Get your monthly tracking, as well as a YTD overview with Performance Tracker\u2019s summaries!<\/p>\n<p><em>\u201cWe are pleased to provide our cemetery clients with two monthly summary email reports.\u00a0The survey summary highlights the prior month and YTD performance with key statistics about the customer\u2019s experience.
