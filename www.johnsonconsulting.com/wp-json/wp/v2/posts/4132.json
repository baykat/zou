The Memorial Classic donors have contributed more than $500,000 to the Funeral Service Foundation since the event began, allowing the Foundation to make meaningful grants and provide educational opportunities and scholarships that promote funeral service and ensure a bright future for our profession.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The Foundation\u2019s Youth &amp; Funerals initiative is designed to help families understand the role that funerals and memorials play in the lives of youth. The Johnson family has always been passionate about Funeral Service Foundation\u2019s mission which includes a strong approach to education that leads to promising careers in funeral service.<\/p>\n<p>According to Tom Johnson, he began this golf tournament 38 years ago with the intent of just getting good friends in Funeral Service together for a few days of fellowship. The Classic now has roughly 130 participants each year who attend the event. \u201cAll of these gentlemen have been extremely generous in supporting the Memorial Classic mission.
