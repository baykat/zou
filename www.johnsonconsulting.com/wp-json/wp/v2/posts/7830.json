Jill shared proven strategies for connecting with potential clients, converting cold leads into hot leads, and how funeral providers can energize their approach to pre-need marketing.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">We started with a key concept: the distinction between cold and hot leaders. Jill said to imagine cold leads as people who might be curious about pre-arranging their funeral but aren&#8217;t quite ready to commit. They&#8217;re like explorers, gathering information and weighing options. On the flip side, hot leads are prepared to dive in\u2014they&#8217;ve decided to pre-arrange and are searching for the right partner to help them. The magic lies in transforming those curious explorers into committed clients. This transformation is no small feat and demands a dynamic blend of traditional wisdom and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.johnsonconsulting.com\/services\/performance-tracker-x\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">cutting-edge funeral home technology<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">We know that community outreach is the heartbeat of connection. It&#8217;s where the real excitement happens for making meaningful connections in the community. Jill and I discussed how funeral homes can become trusted advisors in their communities by engaging in genuine outreach. Jill suggested hosting engaging events like movie nights for Veterans or an informative seminar on Veteran death benefits. Events like this cost trust and familiarity. The secret sauce is focusing on relationships, not sales pitches. It&#8217;s about being a trusted friend, not just another business.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">In our fast-paced digital age, you might think direct mail has gone the way of the dinosaurs. Jill shared that direct mail is still a powerhouse. Sending a physical mailer often leads to warmer client interactions than digital alternatives. Why? Because receiving and responding to mail requires a level of commitment that clicks and likes simply don&#8217;t capture. Combining direct mail with social media for events can bring in similar numbers of leads, but the mail leads often close with more success. It&#8217;s all about finding that sweet spot between tradition and innovation.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Jill and I discussed personalization in marketing, which is more than a trend; it&#8217;s a necessity. Jill stressed that it&#8217;s about making every potential client feel recognized and valued. Recommendations from Jill included using videos and staff photos in marketing materials to send personalized video messages. There are endless ways to make connections feel personal and genuine. The goal is to have potential clients walk through the funeral home doors feeling like they already know you.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 <\/span>Last year Jill posted a video on LinkedIn showing off her cat on National Cat Day. That video turned out to be her most viewed video because it was personal, genuine and it included a pet which was a suggestion from her co-worker.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Every community is unique, with its own culture and preferences. One size definitely doesn&#8217;t fit all in funeral service marketing. Jill stated that success depends on knowing your audience and tailoring your messages to meet their specific needs. This approach addresses natural sales resistance and positions the funeral director or pre-need consultant as a compassionate advisor. By doing so, you build lasting relationships based on understanding and empathy.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">We know that technology is revolutionizing nearly all industries and different types of businesses. One fascinating idea we explored was the concept of an &#8220;empty cart&#8221; feature on <a href=\"https:\/\/www.johnsonconsulting.com\/funeral-home-website-needs\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">funeral home websites<\/a>. People can plan their end-of-life services online, just like shopping on Amazon. This tool provides valuable insights into client preferences. We must remember that technology is only as effective as the people behind it. Ensure your team is well-trained and enthusiastic about using these tools for the best results. Jill mentioned the opportunities that exist when an online consumer has a full shopping cart but doesn&#8217;t check out.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Patience is a virtue, especially when measuring marketing success in funeral service. Jill advocates for a 12-month evaluation period\u2014pre-need marketing programs often reveal their true potential over time. This patient approach helps avoid hasty judgments and allows strategies to flourish fully.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 <\/span>Balancing tradition with innovation will be crucial for a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.johnsonconsulting.com\/enhance-funeral-preneed-sales\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">funeral provider&#8217;s pre-need success<\/a>. It&#8217;s not about choosing between old and new\u2014it&#8217;s about discovering the perfect blend that resonates with your community.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Thank you, Jill, for joining us on Johnson Consulting Conversations!
