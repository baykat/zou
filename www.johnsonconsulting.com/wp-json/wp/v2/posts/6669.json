Armed with death care industry experience and expertise, they can assess the performance of your funeral home and help you implement effective growth initiatives.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But not all funeral business consultants are created equally. Before you put the future of your business in the hands of a consultant, you\u2019ll want to vet them for the right credentials.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here\u2019s what you should look for.<\/p>\n<p><\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">1. Industry Expertise<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Naturally, an ideal consultant will have extensive experience in the death care industry; however, you\u2019ll want to look for a proven track record of success. During initial communications with a funeral business consultant, ask them for examples of their past projects.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Solid death care consultants will be able to provide you with case studies of their work. In these case studies, you\u2019ll be able to take a closer look at how the consultant has partnered with funeral businesses, what initiatives they spearheaded, and what the ultimate results were for the client.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You also should look for enthusiasm in a consultant. During their time with your business, a consultant will act as a trusted partner, making it imperative that the two of you are excited by the projects for your business.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">2. Prior Experience Running a Funeral Home<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The best funeral home consultants have experience operating a funeral business of their own. The significance of this factor comes down to experience. While anyone with a business degree can understand the basic mechanics of how a funeral home works, only a funeral director understands the niche issues, <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">but also it takes a certain type of person to serve families during their most challenging times. Compassion, empathy and educational services need to be highlighted<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On top of this, you\u2019ll want to screen for <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">successful<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> funeral directors. If a consultant\u2019s past experience does not meet your specific requirements, then a collaboration doesn\u2019t bode well for your business.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">3. Connections<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Consultants can help you embark on a variety of business initiatives, including expanding your services, training or hiring staff members, or preparing your funeral home for a sale. To execute these tasks, a consultant will need connections with other professionals.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For example, if you hope to build your own cremation facility, a consultant will ideally be able to connect you with vendors and contractors. These professionals will help with the construction issues. Additionally, they might have connections with cremation workers who can help train your team on the use of these new tools.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">4. Positive Reviews<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Look to a consultant\u2019s Google reviews, social media accounts, and website for authentic reviews from former clients. Pay attention to reviews that mention specific benefits and drawbacks of working with this consultant.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You may even want to reach out directly to former clients of the consultant. Think of this as similar to checking someone\u2019s references at a job interview. After all, you are hiring a consultant for a contract position.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">5. Varying Services<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Depending on your specific needs from a consultant, you might need help with more than one project. For example, an initiative to increase the value of your business may require projects that address <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.johnsonconsulting.com\/preneed-funeral-sales\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">preneed sales<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.johnsonconsulting.com\/remodels-that-wont-break-the-bank\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">facility renovations<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, and the formation of new after care programs.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Because of this, the best consultants should offer a wide range of services. Brokerage, accounting, marketing, and client satisfaction should all be a part of their offerings.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">6. Goal Alignment<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If your business is in need of a serious overhaul, then the process will start with setting new overarching initiatives. To effectively accomplish these initiatives, you\u2019ll need to think about how every team member\u2019s efforts should work in tandem to move your <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.johnsonconsulting.com\/4-pillars-of-success\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">business towards success<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A plan for goal alignment will consist of the initiatives, the specific actions each team member must take to achieve them, a plan for implementation, and an ongoing system for accountability management. Before changing anything about your funeral home, a consultant should be able to clearly articulate this process as it relates to your business.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Top Option<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For funeral directors in need of business consulting, <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.johnsonconsulting.com\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Johnson Consulting Group<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is a leading death care firm with decades of experience.
