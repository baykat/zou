Meyer &#8211; Mortuary Management<\/p>\n<p>Some people approach the sale of their funeral home in an almost casual manner.\u00a0 They talk to their competitor, the competitor is interested and they agree on a price.\u00a0 If they&#8217;re lucky, the deal works well for both of them.<\/p>\n<p>Very frequently, however, this casual, off-the-cuff approach results in problems: the seller discovers (too late) his firm was worth more than the sale price, or he ends up paying more in taxes than necessary because the deal wasn&#8217;t structured properly.\u00a0 Sometimes the parties later realize they don&#8217;t agree on what was actually being sold.\u00a0 For example, the seller intended to keep the real property, whereas the buyer thought it was included in the sale.<\/p>\n<p>To minimize the possibility of problems and to make the best deal possible, approach the sale in a businesslike manner.\u00a0 Begin by discussing your plans with your tax advisor, so that he or she can create the most tax-efficient plan in which the sale could be accomplished.\u00a0 Hire an expert to value your business and to help you market it.\u00a0 Hire an attorney to prepare the necessary sale documents.\u00a0 Yes, hiring advisors will cost you money, but remember: your business and the real estate on which it sits (if you own it) are likely your biggest assets.\u00a0 Don&#8217;t you want to maximize the benefits of a sale &#8211; and minimize the problems?<\/p>\n<p>Once you have your advisors in place, focus on what is most important to you, and talk to your advisors about these issues.\u00a0 Do you want health insurance provided by the buyer?\u00a0 Do you want to be sure the buyer offers employment to a longtime employee?\u00a0 Do you want to work for the new owner and have him pay for certain benefits, such as membership in a country club?\u00a0 It&#8217;s important to identify issues important to you and to inform potential buyers of them early in the process so that the people or companies interested in your firm can account for such requests in formulating their offers.<\/p>\n<p>Think carefully about whether you can be truly happy working for the new owner.\u00a0 After running their own business for many years, many people find it difficult to take orders from someone else.\u00a0 Also, bear in mind that if you sign an employment agreement, the new owner will expect you to promote the funeral home in your community.\u00a0 If you now or suspect that you won&#8217;t agree with the new owner&#8217;s business philosophy and won&#8217;t feel comfortable singing the new owner&#8217;s praises at civic functions and service club meetings &#8211; don&#8217;t enter into an employment agreement.<\/p>\n<p>Finally, read the draft of the purchase agreement carefully, tell\u00a0 your attorney about any corrections and ask questions about anything in the agreement you don&#8217;t understand.\u00a0 Make sure all major points covered in the letter of intent are included in the purchase agreement.\u00a0 Selling your funeral home is a big deal, so treat it accordingly.\u00a0 Proceed cautiously and with lots of advice.<\/p>\n<p><em>(Please note: this column is necessarily brief and doesn&#8217;t purport to be a complete explanation of the law discussed.\u00a0 The information presented is not intended to be, and should not be taken as, legal advice.\u00a0 For advice concerning your particular situation, please consult an attorney.)<\/em><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Selling Your Funeral Home By Douglas O.
