Once a business in which you could rely solely on reputation and relationships, death care is now seeing rising cremation rates, a preference for \u201cgreen\u201d burials, and the increased popularity of alternative celebrations of life.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That\u2019s why it\u2019s important to stay on top of these trends, allowing your funeral business to flourish in both the present and future. Luckily, staying relevant doesn&#8217;t mean splurging on a new cremation facility. Instead, consider these small actionable tips that will ultimately set your business on a course for success.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">1. Get an Annual Valuation<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Valuations are often associated with selling a business, but they should be done annually. The reason for this is awareness. It\u2019s important to always have an idea of where your business stands in terms of value.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.johnsonconsulting.com\/5-reasons-why-you-should-get-a-business-valuation-every-year\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Getting a valuation<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> will not only help you prepare for retirement and simplify your taxes, but it also gives you the hard truth about where your business stands. While a low valuation might not meet your expectations, it can point you toward the types of changes you need to make in order to reach your ideal value.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While there are several quick ways to obtain a valuation, the most common method for funeral homes is multiple analysis. By doubling your revenue or multiplying your cash flow by five, you\u2019ll start to get a rough idea of what your business is worth. Alternatively, you could consider hiring a professional to conduct the valuation for a more nuanced number.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">2. Create and Update a SWOT Analysis<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Used in all lines of work, a SWOT analysis helps you determine where your business is currently situated and how it stands to move\u2013\u2013both positively and negatively. When it comes to planning, a SWOT analysis is a great place to start.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The acronym SWOT includes four components:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li aria-level=\"1\"><b>Strengths: <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This field refers to any exceptional aspects of the business that separate it from the competition. Loyal families, specialized services, and strong preneed portfolios could all be strengths.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<ul>\n<li aria-level=\"1\"><b>Weaknesses: <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Any current shortcomings of a funeral home. High employee turnover, outdated facilities, or declining revenues, for example could all be considered weaknesses.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<ul>\n<li aria-level=\"1\"><b>Opportunities: <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Opportunities refer to any external factors that could give your funeral home a competitive advantage. This could refer to a growing population, a shuttered competitor, or increased interest in your services.<\/span><\/li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\"><b>Threats: <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Contrasting with opportunities, threats consist of external factors that might harm your business. For example, weakened supply chains or a lack of suitable employees might pose threats for a funeral home.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Similar to a valuation, a SWOT analysis should be conducted on a yearly basis, giving you a clearer picture of where your business stands and how to proceed.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">3. Focus on Preneed<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When determining the value of a funeral home, few variables impact this total as much as your <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.johnsonconsulting.com\/preneed-impacts-value\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">preneed sales<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. An extensive backlog of preneed sales indicates both loyalty to your business and a promise of future prospects.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If your preneed program is currently lacking, then devoting more effort to this avenue is a surefire way to increase the value of your funeral home. To <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.johnsonconsulting.com\/increase-your-preneed-sales-with-these-7-tips\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">increase your preneed sales<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, consider the following strategies:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Tactfully touch on preneed offerings as part of your after care.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Network with hospice organizations, nursing homes, and other community players to help spread the word about the importance of pre-arranged services.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Train your sales team in pitching preneed services to families.<\/span><\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">4. Make Aesthetic Changes<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Other than a phone call, the first touchpoint for families comes when they enter your property. Because of this, you\u2019ll want to be sure that your grounds, facilities, and decor are tidy, comfortable, and aesthetically appealing. Instead of spending tens of thousands on new french oak floors, consider making frequent small changes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lighting fixtures, curtains, rugs, and furniture can all be swapped out affordably. And while aesthetic preferences vary by location and individual, the key is to convey a professional and current quality. Update cheaply and gradually, rather than performing one expensive overhaul every ten years.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">5. Get Expert Advice<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although funeral homes all help families honor their loved ones, each business serves different communities, exists in different environments, and thus faces different challenges. If you can\u2019t see an obvious route through which to boost your funeral home\u2019s value, then you might consider calling on some outside help from consultants.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.johnsonconsulting.com\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Johnson Consulting Group<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, one of the nation\u2019s largest death care agencies, we have a team that understands all that goes into running a funeral home.
