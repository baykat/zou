In 2023, we can expect the increasing popularity of alternative memorial services, as well as continuing issues related to staffing.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">More Cremations<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In 1980, the cremation rate in the United States was just <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.statista.com\/statistics\/251702\/cremation-rate-in-the-united-states\/#:~:text=The%20cremation%20rate%20in%20the,to%2064.1%20percent%20by%202025.\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">shy of 10%<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. As of 2021, the cremation rate has soared to nearly 60%, and this trend is only expected to continue.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While there are likely a variety of factors contributing to the popularity of cremations\u2014a more secular population and the low costs of cremations, to name a couple\u2014funeral directors should anticipate a growing demand for these types of services.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">More Non-Traditional Burials and Services<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Similar to cremations, non-traditional burials and services are also growing in popularity. This includes eco-friendly burials, aquamation, and ceremonies that make creative use of cremated remains.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Of the growing majority of those who elect for cremation, <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/nfda.org\/news\/statistics#:~:text=Cremation%20...%20and%20Burial%3A,of%20worship%2C%20or%20some%20other\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">nearly 70%<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> of them don&#8217;t want their cremated remains in a cemetery. Instead of interring cremated remains, many people are choosing to turn them into diamonds or use them as part of the soil for a tree. Alternatively, many people wish to scatter ashes in sentimental places.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Funeral businesses should be prepared to pivot to these types of services rather than forcing traditional models on families.\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Virtual Presentations and Funeral Service Gatherings<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">During the pandemic, when in-person gatherings were impossible to conduct safely, virtual services held over Zoom or Skype offered a necessary substitute. However, virtual presentations and services are still worth considering.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Families might even prefer to hold a hybrid service, in which an in-person service is accompanied by a virtual component, allowing those who are sick or live far away to pay their respects.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Making Arrangements Online<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In a world where we can do everything from the comfort of our homes, many people these days expect the ability to make their arrangements online. Across a variety of industries, we are seeing a growing number of families who&#8217;d <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.bookinglive.com\/customers-prefer-book-online\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">prefer to schedule services and appointments online<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the death care profession, that includes planning the funeral, <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.funeralresultsmarketing.com\/cremation-arrangement-websites\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">making cremation arrangements<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, and booking services \u2013 all online. It can also apply to the paperwork and legal components of a funeral service. The more you can offer online options for people, the better.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Staffing Challenges<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Similar to many other industries, the funeral profession is experiencing a shortage of talent in the wake of the Great Resignation, making it essential to review your compensation plans and company culture. <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.johnsonconsulting.com\/how-to-recruit-and-retain-top-talent-for-your-funeral-business\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ensure that your workplace is attractive<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to potential new hires.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Additionally, you&#8217;ll need a plan in place\u2014one that starts with the onboarding process\u2014that invests in the growth of your team members. If your employees can&#8217;t see a future at your workplace, they&#8217;ll soon leave for other opportunities.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Shifting Death Rate<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Since 2013, <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.macrotrends.net\/countries\/USA\/united-states\/death-rate\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">death rates in the United States<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> have continued to climb, increasing the need for funeral services. In the coming years, some predict this trend will continue, while others expect a reversal.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Either way, you&#8217;ll want to account for both possibilities in your planning and strategy. You don&#8217;t want to stop investing in growth, nor should you spread yourself too thin, offering a mind-boggling number of services not relevant to your families.
