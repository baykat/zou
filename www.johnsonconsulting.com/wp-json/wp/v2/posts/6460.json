The timing must be optimal to ensure <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">maximum value. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This means taking a closer look at the market, examining the financial outlook of your business, and planning the finer points of your <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.johnsonconsulting.com\/plan-your-exit-strategy\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">exit strategy<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While each of these aspects fluctuates over time, keeping track of their statuses will position you for a favorable sale. Start by asking yourself the following questions.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What Does the Market Look Like?<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When looking to sell your funeral business, your first consideration should be the overall state of the market and economy. For example, during the pandemic, some considered selling their funeral home or cemetery and exit the industry altogether; however, in <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">some cases<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, selling a business during a period in which profits may have been unstable or difficult to determine, could cause a business owner to accept a price that was less than they could have yielded under a different environment.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Currently, with the American economy rebounding and in-person gatherings once again being safe, the market has been very favorable to those looking to sell a business.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Examine Your Position in the Market<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Unless you\u2019re the sole funeral home in the region, your position in the market in relation to your competition will also play a role in determining the value of your business. If your market share and stability in the market is better and holds other advantages such as on-site cremation facilities, staffing, etc\u2026\u2013then your business will garner a better price.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Conclusion: A big part of selling your funeral home will be to demonstrate how it is positioned to thrive against other funeral homes. The more opportunity and less risk, the better the value.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Are Your Valuations Where You Want Them to Be?<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ultimately, the market conditions will weigh heavily into the value of your funeral home. While the value of your business can fluctuate\u2013both from internal workings and outside conditions\u2013by learning the current value of your funeral home, you\u2019ll get a rough idea of how much it may sell for today.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One of the most common <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.johnsonconsulting.com\/challenges-selling-funeral-cemetery-business\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">challenges of selling a funeral business<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is when you are confronted with the reality of a low value that does not satisfy your retirement. This is why it\u2019s important to obtain a valuation long before you plan to sell. While a low valuation immediately before your exit leaves you little room to adapt, one conducted long before your planned exit gives you the chance to correct course and increase the value of your business.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What Do Taxes Look Like?\u00a0<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To determine the ideal time to sell your funeral home, you\u2019ll also want to look at the broader picture in terms of taxation. While we\u2019re all familiar with yearly income taxes, many are surprised by the taxation surrounding the sale of a business, that is, <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.johnsonconsulting.com\/funeral-home-tax-strategies\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">capital gains taxes<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When selling a funeral home, you\u2019ll encounter three primary tax-related issues:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If proceeds from your sale are taxed as income or capital gains<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Whether your sale is an all-cash deal or one that requires payment installations<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What is the impact of the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.johnsonconsulting.com\/ma-minute-recap-episode-17\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">depreciation recapture tax<\/a><\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Making matters more complicated, the tax code is always subject to change. There are always fluctuations and considered changes to the long-term capital gains and income tax rate. Because funeral homes tend to be longstanding institutions, the entailed capital gains can be huge, therefore, it would behoove any funeral director approaching retirement to consider the impact of these taxes.\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Naturally, rising taxes do not mean every funeral director should jump ship; rather, it indicates the importance of considering taxes when exploring a sale. Doing so can help you determine the ideal time to put your funeral home on the market.\u00a0 After all, we like to say that we not only specialize in maximizing what you get, BUT also what you keep!<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Life After the Deal?<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Whether you are <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.johnsonconsulting.com\/early-succession-planning\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">passing down the business<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to a family member\/key employee or selling it to an outside buyer, you\u2019ll want to train them in the inner workings of your funeral operations and market. In some cases, these transition periods can last for months, and they usually require the prior owner to stay on in some sort of capacity. While the particulars of this agreement will vary by the buyer, you\u2019ll want to consider the broad strokes of your exit strategy. Make sure to consider:\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If and how you\u2019ll continue to make money after your departure.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What will happen to the business once you\u2019ve left.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How long you will ideally assist the new owner.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What benefits would you like to still have if possible.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Get the Answers You Need<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For all of these questions, it\u2019s important to have solid answers to truly know if it\u2019s the right time to put your funeral home or cemetery up for sale. But the answers to these questions can be hard to pin down.
