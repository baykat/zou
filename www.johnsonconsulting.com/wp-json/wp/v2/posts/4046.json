Succession planning isn\u2019t just so you can retire and pass along the business to the next generation, it\u2019s also preparing yourself, and your business for any unforeseen circumstances, such as deaths or sudden job vacancies. It also sets up a plan so that you as an owner can have a work-life balance by working \u201con\u201d your business, instead of \u201cin\u201d it.<\/p>\n<p>However, Succession Planning is an incredibly strategic process that requires a lot of detailed thought and work. Here are five key helpful questions that you as a funeral or cemetery business owner must think through and ask yourself:<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><strong><u>Are You Preparing The Key Employee?<\/u><\/strong><\/p>\n<p><em>\u201cTrain people well enough so they can leave, treat them well enough so they don&#8217;t want to.\u201d \u2013 Richard Branson<\/em><\/p>\n<p>How you prepare your key employee or family member for the future is key to an excellent succession plan. You should be looking for generational leadership, a legacy protector or builder. This is someone that you would feel comfortable delegating key tasks to, and trust to carry on the legacy of your business. It\u2019s important that they fully understand what is on the line \u2013 for you and for their future.<\/p>\n<p>They might not necessarily be ready at the moment, but if you see potential&#8211;start NOW!\u00a0 It\u2019s never too early to start mentoring and coaching this individual.<\/p>\n<p>Preparing the key employee means investing in their ability to learn. Send them to seminars, classes and workshops. Use outside resources to pour into these individuals to shape them to be the best leader they can possibly be\u2014they are worth the investment.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><strong><u>Are You Addressing Issues With Internal Capabilities?<\/u><\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Cremation rate is increasing.\u00a0 Average sale is shrinking.\u00a0 Costs of doing business are rising, and retaining talented staff continues to cost more.\u00a0 With all of these factors in mind, it is critical that you have a plan and leverage strengths, relationships and experience to counteract what could ultimately drive your business down. It all starts with your internal employees, and addressing these external issues together by coming up with plans and solutions to combat them.<\/p>\n<p>Another important question you need to ask yourself as an owner, is there a growth path for my employees? How do you plan on developing your team?\u00a0 Employee reviews and evaluations are critically important to the overall morale of the workplace.\u00a0 The simple gesture of sitting down and talking with the employee will make a significant difference.<\/p>\n<p>Think of the employee like a consumer, except they are spending the most valuable unrenewable resource \u2013 their time.\u00a0 They are making an incredible investment of time in your business in the hopes of providing a better life for themselves and their family.\u00a0 They will be very interested in their opportunities to improve and gain a greater return on investment (ROI), especially if it involves promotions to leadership and greater earnings.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><strong><u>Are You Working Yourself Out of A Job?\u00a0 <\/u><\/strong><\/p>\n<p>What would you need to do in order to work yourself out of your job and transition all duties? When the time comes for you to pass your responsibilities along, you\u2019ll want it to be a seamless process. Which is why it\u2019s crucial to build out a team you know you can trust. Many owners struggle because they have the <em>\u201cdo it all\u201d <\/em>mentality, and they find it difficult to delegate different responsibilities because they are used to doing it themselves. They end up getting too hung up on <em>how <\/em>tasks get done, instead of just allowing talented management to take care of it. Your staff needs to have the freedom and flexibility to accomplish the task their own way and if you allow them to take the reins, you will be impressed at what you will learn!<\/p>\n<p>Empowering others is not a sign of weakness, it\u2019s an opportunity to develop your team and provide positive accountability. Find ways to empower your team members with functions that are best handed by them so that it makes this transition much easier in the future.<\/p>\n<p>Many owners are limited on their ability to pursue opportunities due to a lack of time or time management.\u00a0 If you consider your hourly wage (your annual income divided by 2,080 hours) and apply that to some of the jobs you do, you might just find it would be much better economically if someone else was trained and provided the opportunity to grown into a new job or role responsibility. And in the end, this also provides for transitional development over time.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><strong><u>Are You Following a Strategic Plan? <\/u><\/strong><\/p>\n<p><em>\u201cA dream written down with a date becomes a goal.\u00a0 A goal broken down into steps becomes a plan.\u00a0 A plan backed by actions makes your dreams come true.\u201d\u00a0 -Greg Reid<\/em><\/p>\n<p>We are all busy working, \u201cin\u201d the business \u2013 handling the tasks and activities that we have to accomplish on a on a day-to-day basis. As business owners, it\u2019s so critical that we don\u2019t get stuck working in the business that we don\u2019t allow ourselves, and company, to grow and reach new levels of success. Now this is much easier said than done, so how do you create time to reach those huge company goals and big milestones?<\/p>\n<p>Work \u201con\u201d your business by identifying 3-5 key company initiatives that are supported by tactical actions. Start by creating a strategic plan and getting key team members in on the process, and meet throughout the year to hold each other accountable.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Take a look at the following examples:<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Key Initiative:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Increase Revenues 10%<\/p>\n<p>Action Plan:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Strategic Pricing Review<\/p>\n<p>Who: \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 General Manager<\/p>\n<p>When: \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Q1 2019<\/p>\n<p>Action Plan:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Arrangement Conference Presentation Training<\/p>\n<p>Who:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Lead Funeral Director<\/p>\n<p>When:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Q1 2019 and ongoing quarterly<\/p>\n<p>Action Plan:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Merchandising Review<\/p>\n<p>Who:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 General Manager<\/p>\n<p>When:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Q1 2019<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Key Initiative:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Increase Call Volume 3%<\/p>\n<p>Action Plan:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Initiative Community Outreach Plan<\/p>\n<p>Who:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 General Manager<\/p>\n<p>When:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Q1 2019 and ongoing<\/p>\n<p>Action Plan:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Phone &amp; Price Shopper Training<\/p>\n<p>Who:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Lead Funeral Director<\/p>\n<p>When:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Q2 2019<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Each employee can and should have personal goals to grow in the Company, but as an employer, you should ensure that the employee\u2019s plan supports the Company.\u00a0 If the employee is a candidate for future leadership within the Company, remember that their personal strategic plan should include steps which support that development such as higher level of leadership and management training.<\/p>\n<p><strong><u>Are You Creating Job Redundancy? <\/u><\/strong><\/p>\n<p>What happens when that key employee that knows the ins and outs of your business decides to leave?
