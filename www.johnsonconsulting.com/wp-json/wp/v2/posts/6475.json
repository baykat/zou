Now What?"},"content":{"rendered":"<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Unless you have an infinite supply of unused land, then there will come a time when your cemetery runs out of space for burials\u2013this is especially true if your cemetery is landlocked. Naturally, approaching this limit is cause for concern. After all, if you no longer have space for plots, then that could pose a big problem for the families you serve.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Luckily, there are some clever ways to <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.johnsonconsulting.com\/applying-agile-thinking-to-your-business\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">ensure continued business<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u2013\u2013short of purchasing additional land. From augmenting your existing space with mausoleums to emphasizing alternatives to traditional burials, you can make the most of finite space.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Consider Mausoleums<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While the term mausoleum often conjures up images of grand structures and opulent burials, a mausoleum can refer to any freestanding structure\u2013\u2013of any size\u2013\u2013used for burials. Most often built above-ground, mausoleums are widely considered a more ecologically friendly option because they allow for more efficient use of space than traditional burials.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Additionally, it\u2019s important to note that mausoleums can also be used to house cremated remains.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For the average American cemetery, you might want to consider the following types of mausoleums:<\/span><b><\/b><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li aria-level=\"1\"><b>Public mausoleums: <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sometimes referred to as community mausoleums, public mausoleums are generally large above-ground structures that house the remains of anyone who wishes to be entombed within. Generally more affordable than private mausoleums, this option also might offer decor elements such as name plaques and vases for the placement of flowers or other tokens of affection.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<ul>\n<li aria-level=\"1\"><b>Family mausoleums: <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Also known as private mausoleums, family mausoleums are used to house the remains of specific families. Smaller than public mausoleums, this variety is ideal for those who wish to be close to their loved ones, even after their passing.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<ul>\n<li aria-level=\"1\"><b>Garden mausoleums: <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Unlike family and public mausoleums, which are structures with indoor areas, garden mausoleums are entirely outdoors. That said, <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.archdaily.com\/326697\/lakewood-garden-mausoleum-hga\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">outdoor mausoleums<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> often feature a more inventive architectural design that melds with the surroundings.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Regardless of the type of mausoleum you elect to implement, they\u2019ll allow you to maximize your usage of space and, in some cases, create an additional revenue stream.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Provide Alternative Options<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With cremations growing in popularity compared to traditional burials, it would behoove any funeral director or cemetery owner to incorporate cremation packages into their services. On top of this, <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.johnsonconsulting.com\/make-your-funeral-business-more-profitable\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">alternative burial arrangements<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> are growing in popularity, offering ample opportunity beyond burials.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In addition to traditional cremations, you might want to consider:<\/span><b><\/b><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li aria-level=\"1\"><b>Biodegradable urns: <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Unlike traditional cremations, in which you bury or otherwise store the cremated remains, biodegradable urns offer a green alternative. Biodegradable or living urns use cremated remains to spur the growth of a plant, most often a tree. For many people, the growth of a tree provides them with a lasting and near-permanent memory of their loved ones.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<ul>\n<li aria-level=\"1\"><b>Aquamation: <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We generally think of cremation as a process of burning. Aqua cremation (also known as aquamation or alkaline hydrolysis) liquefies human remains in a mixture of potassium hydroxide and water. This method uses less energy than traditional cremation, and it returns the water remains to the water supply, giving families the remaining bones, which are turned to ash.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<ul>\n<li aria-level=\"1\"><b>Human composting (Natural Organic Reduction): <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While the name may turn off some families, human composting or <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">recomposting <\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">takes unembalmed remains and turns them into soil. Similar to biodegradable urns, the resulting soil is often used to grow a tree or other sentimental plant. For those uninterested in traditional gravesites, human composting is seen as a beautiful and green way to honor their loved ones.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Outsource<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Alternative arrangements aside, another option might be to make <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.johnsonconsulting.com\/funeral-home-strategies-partnerships\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">agreements with other cemeteries<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in your area. This way, when you no longer have space, you can still provide options to those who want it.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When you notice your existing space growing scarce, this is a good option to explore, as it ensures you\u2019ll still be able to provide assistance to those who want traditional burials.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What\u2019s Best For Your Funeral Home<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While many think of death care as a staid profession, the data shows that the ways in which people prefer to honor their loved ones are rapidly changing. A more secular population, a consciousness of eco-friendliness, and an embracing of new traditions are all contributing to a rapidly changing profession. To help ensure your cemetery can stay on top of current trends, you\u2019ll want to seek the help of death care experts.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Composed of lifetime funeral and cemetery professionals, <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.johnsonconsulting.com\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Johnson Consulting Group<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> has a team of experts who can help.
