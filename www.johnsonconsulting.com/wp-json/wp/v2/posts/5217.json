We understand that funeral service is of the utmost importance to our clients, which makes it just as important for our team. The COVID-19 crisis has had a significant impact on the funeral profession, and we are proud to offer our unwavering support during these tough times.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 500;\">COVID-19 Crisis Response Fund<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 500;\">The Memorial Classic, headed by <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 500;\">Tom and Jake Johnson<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 500;\"> of Johnson Consulting Group, recently contributed $30,000 to the Funeral Service Foundation to help fund the<\/span><\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.funeralservicefoundation.org\/covid19fund\/\"> <span style=\"font-weight: 500;\">COVID-19 Crisis Response Fund<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 500; color: #000000;\"> for emergency assistance and grief support. The Funeral Service Foundation has served as the funeral profession\u2019s philanthropic voice since 1945, building meaningful relationships with families and communities and offering compassionate care no matter the circumstances.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 500; color: #000000;\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 500; color: #000000;\">The Foundation created the fund as a timely response to the COVID-19 situation, and the program provides various grants:<\/span><\/p>\n<ol>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 500;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 500; color: #000000;\">For immediate needs within funeral service including emergency response to significant loss of life.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 500;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 500; color: #000000;\">To organizations providing services and resources to families with unresolved and complicated grief due to loss during this crisis.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 500;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 500; color: #000000;\">For other important needs as funeral service continues to serve families during this rapidly evolving crisis.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 500; color: #000000;\">\u201cAs long-time advocates of the Foundation we know that it\u2019s even more important to give our full support during this very unique and challenging time,\u201d said Tom Johnson (Founder of Johnson Consulting Group). JCG routinely donates to the Funeral Service Foundation\u2019s annual Memorial Classic, but even though the event did not take place this year The Memorial Classic continues to be a strong ally of the Foundation.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 500;\">Pillars of Support<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 500; color: #000000;\">The COVID-19 Crisis Response Fund is designed to be flexible, and grant funding is available for US and Canadian nonprofits as well as funeral homes and funeral service-related businesses working in conjunction with an exempt organization which agrees to serve as the fiscal agent for the grant.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 500; color: #000000;\">Funding priorities for emergency assistance include helping funeral homes secure personal protective equipment (PPE) supplies and reimbursements for volunteers traveling to help funeral directors in \u201chot spot\u201d regions.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 500; color: #000000;\">The Funeral Service Foundation is also focused on providing support for families coping with delayed or complicated grief. Grief is a unique and personal experience and we all grieve in our own way, however grieving the loss of a family member or a close friend during the 2020 pandemic has been particularly difficult. The Response Fund addresses this need by offering grief guides that detail the challenges of grieving a loved one alone and apart from family and friends (guides are available in English and Spanish). Mental health services are also available for funeral service professionals who are overworked and\/or stressed from dealing with the public health crisis.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 500; color: #000000;\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 500; color: #000000;\">\u201cWhat a gift of this size means, especially in a year when the event was cancelled really speaks to [the Memorial Classic\u2019s] ongoing commitment to the funeral profession and the Foundation,\u201d said Lee Wiensch, Executive Director of the Funeral Service Foundation.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 500; color: #000000;\">Wiensch continued by saying that \u201c(they) have been long time and giant supporters and we are so grateful for [their] gifts over time. [Their] gift this year means a lot especially during a difficult time. It helps us respond meaningfully to the COVID-19 crisis and continues to provide scholarships and the sorts of programs that funeral professionals need from the Foundation.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 500;\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 500;\">Created for Partnership<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 500; color: #000000;\">The Memorial Classic and Johnson Consulting Group are both proud to partner with the Funeral Service Foundation in responding meaningfully to the COVID-19 crisis. \u201cIt&#8217;s our privilege to work with such a vital group of individuals and we are excited to continue our support of the Foundation and its mission for years to come,\u201d said Jake Johnson (President\/CEO).\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 500;\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 500; color: #000000;\">The Funeral Service foundation created a Thank You video for Tom and Jake Johnson\u2019s contributions to the COVID-19 relief found.
