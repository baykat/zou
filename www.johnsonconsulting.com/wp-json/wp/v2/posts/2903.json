We always suggest that an owner get, at a minimum,\u00a0a &#8220;limited valuation&#8221; once every other year so they know what their value is and how they can increase that value.\u00a0 The next question asked was\u00a0if the business had received a valuation in the last three years.\u00a0 The results showed that less than half had a valuation done on their business. I believe a valuation is critical to make sure you know where you are today with your most valuable asset. \u00a0\u00a0Of the respondents, further questioning revealed that 83% felt that their business would be more valuable in the future.\u00a0 This is great news and a strong reason to stay in the business!\u00a0 A few respondents, however, felt that their business would be worth less in the future and I would hope that they are seeking ways to determine their current value so they can measure and create strategic plans to correct that trend.\u00a0 If the outlook is still bad after performing those steps, then obviously it may be time to consider selling in the near future.\u00a0 One of the other questions with a rather interesting level of responses was the question, &#8220;Have you started a succession plan?&#8221;\u00a0 Of the responses, 66% said no!\u00a0 Interestingly enough, I think a business owner should ALWAYS be working on a succession plan whether that means to begin a plan to transfer ownership, or simply succession of key roles so that the culture and the service standards are never in jeopardy when attrition of key staff occurs.\u00a0 I call this, &#8220;Addressing the &#8216;hit by the bus&#8217; issue&#8221;.\u00a0 We always want to create good redundancy in roles and procedures so that our service standards never falter, but rather continue to improve.\u00a0 To conclude, knowing where you&#8217;ve been and where you are through conducting\u00a0a business valuation will help you know where you want to go and how you want to get there!
