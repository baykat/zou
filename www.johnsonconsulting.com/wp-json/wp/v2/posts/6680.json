Beyond facilitating a memorial service, your staff should provide for the emotional and logistical issues that come with a loved one\u2019s passing.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With that said, it\u2019s not always obvious when your services fall short of such lofty goals, making it essential to develop metrics to measure your client experience. A simple yet effective way to do this is determining your NPS score.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What is an NPS Score?<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A net promoter score (NPS) allows you to measure the loyalty of customers to your funeral home. Developed by <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.bain.com\/consulting-services\/customer-strategy-and-marketing\/customer-loyalty\/#:~:text=Net%20Promoter%20System%E2%84%A0,-Overview&amp;text=The%20Net%20Promoter%20ScoreSM,and%20creativity%20of%20your%20employees.\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Bain and Company<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, NPS is widely viewed as the standard metric of customer (or family) experience.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To find your NPS, you\u2019ll start by asking families a single question. Based on their responses, you can begin to gauge how they perceive your funeral home.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Question<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Widely used in customer satisfaction surveys, NPS consists of one sole question: <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How likely are you to recommend [funeral home name or service] to a friend or colleague.\u00a0<\/span><\/i><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Families should answer this question on a scale from 0 (not at all likely) to 10 (incredibly likely).\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Equation<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Once you\u2019ve gathered a decent sample size of responses, you can calculate your NPS by subtracting the percentage of families who respond with a 6 or lower from the percentage of those who answer with a 9 or 10. The score can range anywhere from -100 to 100.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For example, let\u2019s say you\u2019ve obtained 30 responses to your question. You have 20 responses of a 9 or greater (66%) and 8 responses of a 6 or lower (26%). This would give you an NPS of 40.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Results<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Based on individual scores, the NPS framework divides families into three different categories:\u00a0<\/span><b><\/b><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li aria-level=\"1\"><b>Detractors (Score of 0-6):<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> A family that scored your funeral home in this manner won\u2019t likely recommend your services to others. In fact, they might even actively discourage others from seeking your services.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<ul>\n<li aria-level=\"1\"><b>Passives (Score of 7-8): <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While they do not pose a threat to your funeral home, those in <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.johnsonconsulting.com\/difference-between-happy-and-satisfied-funeral-families\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">the passive group<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> are unlikely to recommend your services. Most importantly, these people could be converted to promoters with a bit of effort, making it important to learn what held them back from scoring your business more favorably.<\/span><\/li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\"><b>Promoters: (Score of 9-10): <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Fully happy with the experience provided by your funeral home, promoters will not only remain loyal to your business, but they\u2019ll also boost your reputation through word of mouth.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">By calculating your funeral home\u2019s NPS, you can begin to understand how families feel about your services. By inquiring further as to the nature of their responses, you can also draft initiatives to create more enthusiastic families.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How to Get Your NPS Score<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To obtain an NPS for your funeral home, you can add the NPS question to your existing feedback survey. Alternatively, you might even consider sending out an email that only contains the NPS question. For example, with <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.j3techsolutions.com\/performance-tracker\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">J3Tech Solutions Performance Tracker <\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">X, you could send emails directly to families and monitor the results on your computer.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Why Does Your NPS Score Matter<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">An NPS provides a comprehensive way to examine the satisfaction of your families. When targeted toward particular services (cremation, for example), you can even use it to find more granular insights regarding particular facets of your funeral home.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This metric also serves as a useful launch point for more thoroughly understanding your families. While a low NPS provides little in terms of tangible, constructive criticism, it can certainly provide you the basis for a conversation with detractors and passives, both of whom can ideally be converted to more enthusiastic clients.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When measured over time, an NPS allows you to track your funeral home\u2019s performance and progress. A steadily increasing score will let you know that your <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.johnsonconsulting.com\/5-improvements-build-value\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">strategic growth efforts<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> are working, while a declining score can alert you of deeper issues.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How to Handle the Results<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Unless your funeral home miraculously scores a 100, your NPS will undoubtedly illustrate that there\u2019s room for improvement. In many cases, you\u2019ll want to focus heavily on families that fall into the passive group and figure out how you can provide them with more fulfilling services. To help plan these types of initiatives, you might also enlist the help of consultants.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.johnsonconsulting.com\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Johnson Consulting Group<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, our team of death care professionals has decades of experience working with funeral directors to provide a better experience for families.
