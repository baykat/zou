										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The funeral profession has long provided avenues for entrepreneurship, and now, more than ever, the opportunities to become your own boss are growing. <a href="https://nfda.org/news/in-the-news/nfda-news/id/8215/plan-for-prosperity-with-foresight-and-johnson-consulting" target="_blank" rel="noopener">According to recent National Funeral Directors Association (NFDA) statistics</a>, there will be a significant number of funeral home ownership transfers within the next five years. With approximately 18,000 funeral homes in the U.S., and 80% of those handling 100 or fewer calls annually, many current owners are facing succession. This creates a prime opportunity for funeral directors to step up and become business owners.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, the allure of ownership should be approached with careful consideration. While the idea of having the freedom to set your own schedule and make decisions without supervision is appealing, there are inherent challenges. Being a good funeral director doesn’t necessarily equate to being a good manager, and similarly, good managers don’t always make good owners. It&#8217;s critical to recognize personal inadequacies and work on developing the skills necessary to succeed as an owner.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://funeraldirectordaily.com/going-into-business-on-your-own/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">As Tom noted in his article</a>, the journey from funeral director to owner requires a deep understanding of what ownership entails. It’s easy to look at the rewards of owning a business without fully appreciating the hard work required to reach that level. The climb to the top involves a great deal of learning, adaptation, and a willingness to let go of certain tasks in order to assume the broader responsibilities of ownership.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When exploring funeral home ownership opportunities, it&#8217;s advisable to memorialize any promises of future ownership in writing with a current owner. Without a formal agreement, there is little foundation to build on, and years of hard work might not result in an ownership stake. Aspiring owners should also be prepared to enhance their leadership and management skills through conferences and training programs, such as those offered by <a href="https://www.johnsonconsulting.com/services/jcg-academy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Johnson Consulting Group’s Leadership and Management Academies</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>One of the current advantages in our profession is the availability of financing. With the right preparation, a bank can fund the purchase of a funeral home, allowing the new owner to pay back a loan over time while keeping the business for themselves. This is a key part of the American dream, but it requires thorough financial readiness, both in terms of savings and skill set. Aspiring owners must be equipped to manage debt and know when and where to seek assistance.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It’s important to remember that the learning process never stops. As an owner, others will look to you for answers, which can create pressure. But, it’s crucial to continue growing and seeking support when needed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Looking at the next generation, there’s often a misconception that “They won’t work as hard as previous generations”. However, today’s business professionals are finding innovative ways to balance work and life. Through outsourcing, leveraging resources like associations and the internet, and using study groups, younger professionals are finding efficient ways to accomplish their goals without overworking themselves. In summary, it’s more about prioritizing balance and using the abundant resources available.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In conclusion, owning and running a funeral business isn’t for everyone, but it can be incredibly rewarding. The key to success lies in taking care of the families you serve…Period! If you can do that, they will take care of you. With the right preparation, support, and willingness to learn, you can enjoy the many benefits of ownership and establish a successful future for you and your family.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In the funeral service profession, financial control is the cornerstone of a sustainable and profitable business. At Johnson Consulting Group, we understand the unique challenges funeral home owners face, from regulatory compliance to managing sensitive customer relations. Mastering financial control ensures your business not only survives but thrives in this compassionate yet competitive field. This article will help you craft a strategic financial plan and implement key strategies to sustain your business.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>Crafting a Strategic Financial Plan for Funeral Homes</strong></h2>
<p>Developing a robust business plan is the first step toward financial mastery in the funeral service profession. This plan serves as a roadmap, guiding your funeral home through budgeting, forecasting, and cash flow management. A well-crafted business plan showcases the viability and strategic vision of your funeral home.</p>
<h3><strong>Key Elements of a Financial Plan:</strong></h3>
<ol>
<li><strong>Budgeting and Forecasting</strong>: Establish clear financial goals and projections to guide your business decisions.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.johnsonconsulting.com/funeral-home-cash-flow-management/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Cash Flow Management</strong></a>: Maintain a steady cash flow to ensure operational efficiency and sustainability. Consider using a thirteen-week cash flow analysis provided on a weekly basis.</li>
</ol>
<p>Understanding a comprehensive financial strategy will enable your funeral home to provide essential services while maintaining financial health.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>Balancing Empathy with Economics in Funeral Service</strong></h2>
<p>Funeral home owners face the delicate task of blending empathy with economic viability. Financial control is crucial in balancing these elements, ensuring that pricing structures are fair and transparent while supporting your business&#8217;s profitability.</p>
<h3><strong>Strategies for Balancing Empathy with Economics:</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Transparent Pricing</strong>: A key consideration would be placing your prices on your website. Also, utilizing phone shopping vendors to ensure you are not only in compliance but providing all options to families guarantees your transparency and compliance.</li>
<li><strong>Cost Management</strong>: Control expenses on essentials like caskets and services to keep operations efficient and families happy.</li>
<li><strong>Revenue Tracking</strong>: A detailed sales contract analysis ensures that you know exactly what the average sales are per case type along with the averages of the items sold within those calls. This ensures that your pricing is not only competitive, but that you&#8217;re recovering your pricing as a correlation to the average sale you&#8217;re receiving.</li>
</ul>
<p>By combining compassionate care with sound financial strategies, you can offer meaningful services while maintaining a viable business model.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>Sustaining Your Funeral Home Business</strong></h2>
<p>Effective financial control is key to sustaining a funeral service business. Strategic planning helps you adapt to market changes while honoring the emotional aspects of our profession.</p>
<h3><strong>Key Financial Strategies for Sustainability:</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Budgeting</strong>: Predictable costs ensure affordability for clients and stability for your business.</li>
<li><a href="https://files.constantcontact.com/d90f336d001/f097c1e4-7b76-427c-b3a9-2a56c1c1315b.pdf?rdr=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Financial Forecasting</strong></a>: Prepare for industry trends and future demands in your market.</li>
<li><strong>Investment in Staff Training</strong>: Enhance service quality and succession planning which fosters client trust and loyalty.</li>
</ul>
<p>A well-structured financial plan empowers your funeral home to meet customer needs with integrity, ensuring both dignified services and business longevity.</p>
<p>In Conclusion, crafting a strategic financial plan is the foundation of a thriving funeral service business. By focusing on budgeting, cash flow management, and balancing empathy with economics, funeral home owners can sustain their operations and serve their communities effectively.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>With the <a href="https://windhambrannon.com/blog/tcja-sunsetting-tax-strategy-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA)</a> provisions set to expire at the end of 2025, business owners and individuals alike face significant tax changes. These changes will affect both personal and business finances. In this Q&amp;A with the Johnson Consulting Team, we’ll explore the major tax provisions expiring and the strategies business owners should consider as the sunset of the TCJA approaches.</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<h2><strong>Q: Which major tax provisions from the TCJA are set to expire at the end of 2025?</strong></h2>
<p>A: Individuals and families can expect tax increases, but for business owners, the most concerning provisions include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Loss of the Section 199A Deduction</strong>: This deduction, currently available to pass-through entities (such as S-corporations and LLCs), allows business owners to deduct up to 20% of qualified business income. When this expires, pass-through entities will lose a valuable tax-saving tool, potentially increasing the tax burden on small businesses and entrepreneurs.</li>
<li><strong>Loss of Caps on State and Local Tax (SALT) Deductions in High-Tax States</strong>: Taxpayers in states with high income and property taxes could face higher overall tax liabilities as the current $10,000 cap on state and local tax deductions disappears.</li>
<li><strong>Reversion of Capital Gains Tax Rates</strong>: Capital gains tax rates will revert to being determined by your regular income tax bracket. This means that individuals in higher income brackets may see a significant increase in their tax rate on long-term capital gains.</li>
<li><strong>Reduction in Estate and Gift Tax Exclusion</strong>: The current estate and gift tax exclusion of $12.92 million per individual will drop by nearly 50%, meaning estates valued over approximately $6 million will be subject to estate taxes. This change could affect many families planning to transfer wealth to the next generation, making estate planning a crucial step in the coming years.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<h2><strong>Q: What tax strategies should funeral home and cemetery business owners consider as 2025 approaches?</strong></h2>
<p>A: One key strategy is to consider accelerating your income before the TCJA provisions expire. With capital gains rates set to revert to higher levels based on your income tax bracket, now is an optimal time to sell assets, take profits, or increase distributions. By doing so, you can take advantage of the lower rates now, reducing your tax liability compared to what it would be under future tax rules.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This strategy is particularly beneficial for those with capital assets such as stocks, real estate, or business interests that have appreciated significantly over time. Locking in current capital gains rates could save you a substantial amount in taxes before the rates increase post-2025.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Other considerations may be to reevaluate your business structure, either converting it to a C-Corp or an S-Corp to lessen taxes. It may also be an opportunity to increase contributions to retirement plans, investing in capital equipment, or exploring tax-advantaged benefits for employees.</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<h2><strong>The Importance of Timing in Succession Planning</strong></h2>
<p>When it comes to succession planning, the timing of a sale can have a significant impact on the value you ultimately retain. In the words of Jake Johnson, &#8220;It&#8217;s not what you get, it&#8217;s what you keep.&#8221; Even though the sale price of a business may remain the same before and after 2025, the amount you keep after taxes will change. This is due to the potential tax increases that could arise when the TCJA provisions expire.</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<h2><strong>Q: How should funeral home and cemetery business owners approaching a succession plan think about the timing of a sale?</strong></h2>
<p>A: If you&#8217;re considering <a href="https://www.johnsonconsulting.com/services/sell-my-business/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">transferring your funeral home or cemetery business</a>, now may be the optimal time to maximize the value of your business. With the potential tax increases on the horizon, selling before the end of 2025 could result in you keeping more of the proceeds.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;It’s just food for thought and something business owners should be aware of,&#8221; Jake continued. &#8220;If you were planning to sell around 2025, the tax changes might push you to reconsider your timing. Even if you’re not quite ready to sell, it’s worth considering whether selling now could help you avoid a higher tax bill later.&#8221;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The core idea is that waiting until 2026 or 2027 could mean a larger tax burden, requiring your business to make up the difference in growth or additional calls on capital. By transferring before the end of 2025, you may be able to capture a more favorable tax position and keep more of the proceeds from the sale. However, it’s important to remember that not everyone will be ready to sell at that time, so planning ahead and discussing options with a tax advisor is crucial.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In conclusion, with the expiration of these TCJA provisions on the horizon, proactive tax and succession planning are essential, working closely with a financial advisor will help you craft the best strategies to minimize your tax burden.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>At Johnson Consulting Group, we evaluate four key areas within a funeral business to gauge its success: financial, workplace, customer service, and marketplace. In this article, we focus on the marketplace, particularly preneed sales, and their impact on the business&#8217;s overall value.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>Preneed Sales: Asset or Liability?</strong></h2>
<p>One of the frequent questions we encounter is whether preneed sales are an asset or a liability for a funeral business. The answer is both. In accounting terms, preneed sales are considered deferred revenue, which is technically a liability. However, the value of a robust preneed book of business is invaluable for future enterprise value.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>Starting with Preneed Programs</strong></h2>
<p>There are numerous third-party marketing companies that can assist with implementing preneed programs, or you can manage it in-house. Regardless of the method, setting a monthly sales target is crucial. Ideally, for every at need contract, we aim to replace it with 1 to 2 preneed contracts.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Our analysis of various funeral homes across the United States and Canada indicates that preneed contracts typically represent 35% of the annual at need case volume at a funeral home. This statistic is often referenced when evaluating the value of the preneed book of business. For instance, a funeral home with $5 million in their preneed account, might see only 35% of that amount come to fruition annually. In other words, that represents 35% of the total at need revenue for the year. Then, taking into consideration the correlating operating expenses of the business, the result is excess cash. This method creates a simple view of how to determine the value of the contribution of the preneed total book of business.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For further insight, consider a funeral home with an annual revenue of $1 million (excluding cash advances), where $350,000 of that revenue is derived from preneed contracts converting to at need. This revenue then incurs expenses, and the resulting <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/ebitda.asp#:~:text=EBITDA%2C%20or%20earnings%20before%20interest,generated%20by%20the%20company's%20operations." target="_blank" rel="noopener">EBITDA</a> (Earnings before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, Amortization) is multiplied to determine the business&#8217;s value. Additionally, preneed sales help lock in today’s family preferences, which is crucial as trends like rising cremation rates continue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>Importance of Monitoring and Training</strong></h2>
<p>We believe that what gets measured gets done. Therefore, having a budget, weekly sales reviews, and consistent <a href="https://www.johnsonconsulting.com/services/jcg-academy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">funeral home training in customer service</a> are essential. Even funeral businesses experiencing a decline in at need volume often maintain consistent preneed case volume. This consistency highlights the loyalty families feel when they pre-plan and return to the same funeral home.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2>
<p>When asked if a preneed program is an asset or liability, it is clear to us that it is a significant asset that enhances the value of a funeral business. However, careful planning and monitoring are necessary to ensure that preneed sales do remain an asset and not a liability. At Johnson Consulting Group, we conduct numerous contract analysis studies and provide strategic planning guidance to ensure the effectiveness of these programs. Our partnerships with third-party experts further support our clients in maximizing their business value through preneed sales.</p>

				<div class="et_pb_text_inner"><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When selling a funeral home business, owners are often in new and perhaps unchartered territory. There are legal factors, unknown tax implications due to sale structure, negotiations, marketing, working through due diligence (inspections, compilation of business documents and financial information, etc.) managing the transaction to closing once an offer is signed, and a lot of organization that is required to cross the finish line. Enlisting and entrusting an experienced third-party to help guide and navigate your team  through the transaction journey, is the best way to ensure you’re getting the best price and will experience a smooth transition from current Owner to new Owner. Here’s how to determine the right representation for your business:</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><b> Calm the Complex:</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When it comes to <a href="https://www.johnsonconsulting.com/services/sell-my-business/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">selling your funeral home business</a>, emotions can run high. It&#8217;s a deeply personal decision that can be clouded by personal attachment to the legacy you&#8217;ve built. This is where a third-party representative becomes invaluable. By serving as a neutral mediator, while representing your best interests with the goal of maximizing value, they bring objectivity to the table, taking the emotion out of the transaction. With their guidance, negotiations remain focused on practical considerations rather than personal attachments, ensuring that decisions are made with clarity and rationally. By providing a calm and impartial perspective, third-party representatives help both buyers and sellers navigate the process with professionalism and efficiency, ultimately leading to a smooth transition of ownership and higher probability of success.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><b> Knowing the Profession:</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The process of selling your funeral home includes several stages and phases. Partnering with a representative that understands each step of the journey, as well as, funeral home operations, finance, and vetted buyers, is invaluable for the insights and guidance along the way to <a href="https://www.johnsonconsulting.com/7-strategies-to-increase-your-funeral-homes-value-over-time/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">maximize the value of your business</a>. From initial negotiations on an acceptable structure to the various facets of due diligence and closing such as covenants not to compete, employment agreements, and consulting agreements,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> their knowledge and experience ensures that no aspect of the process is overlooked. With a deep understanding of industry norms, regulations, and best practices, they can anticipate potential challenges and easily navigate through them. Furthermore, their familiarity with the nuances of funeral home operations allows for tailored structures and solutions that address specific needs and concerns. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><b> Communication as a Catalyst:</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Effective communication is paramount. With transparency as the cornerstone, having a representative who comprehensively understands the profession’s dynamics ensures clarity and communication throughout the process. Their expertise enables them to communicate with you and understand your concerns as a funeral home operator. Furthermore, their insider knowledge empowers them to develop a compelling marketing package that showcases the unique strengths of your funeral home, attracting the right buyers (qualified and vetted buyers) who align with your succession goals. By entrusting your sale to a seasoned funeral business representative, you can rest assured that your wishes are communicated effectively to the buyers and that your marketing presentation represents your business with the utmost integrity and accuracy of historical and future growth.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><b> Uncovering Hidden Opportunities:</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For a <a href="https://www.johnsonconsulting.com/services/funeral-home-and-cemetery-business-brokers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">funeral profession M&amp;A advisor</a>, their expertise extends beyond mere transaction facilitation; they possess the experience and knowledge of how to effectively market a business within this unique industry. They know specifically what financial and business information to include in the marketing package to provide an overall understanding of the history of your business, as well as, what the future holds based on trend analyses. By leveraging their expertise, they can accurately assess whether your business is positioned to command top dollar in the market today, or if there are areas that need improvement to maximize its value and look at marketing the business in the future. Partnering with such a seasoned professional ensures that your business receives the attention it deserves and that you achieve the best possible outcome in the sale process.</span></p>

]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Selling a funeral business is one of the most exciting times for an owner; however, it is a complex process that requires a great deal of thought and planning. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To ensure the success of the sale, there are a number of factors to consider. From setting realistic expectations to finding the right outside help, selling your funeral business is a difficult act to pull off, but if you do it right, you can guarantee that the sale sets you up for success – whether this means retirement or moving on to your next venture. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In this guide, we’ll review all the steps an owner must take from start to finish when selling a business. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Planning is Crucial</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before you start the sale process, it is important to plan ahead. Take the time to understand your business’s current financial health, market position, and future prospects. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Beyond this, you’ll also want to consider what your goals are with the sale. Are you hoping to exit a lifetime of work and retire in Florida, or are you hoping to sell the business and remain on the team in some capacity?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By planning out what your ultimate aim is, you can begin to figure out when you might sell, for how much, and to whom.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Set Realistic Goals</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As you plan, it’s important to outline realistic goals. Naturally, every owner wants to sell their funeral home for the maximum price in the shortest amount of time, but this may not always be possible, depending on the state of your business and the greater market conditions. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unlike real estate, in which homes may sell within a day of hitting the market, the death care industry is more specialized. Not just anyone can buy a funeral business, and among those individuals buying, not everyone is qualified.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By being realistic about the timeline of your sale, as well as your business’s asking price, you can prevent </span><a href="https://www.johnsonconsulting.com/regrets-selling-funeral-home/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">settling for less than you’re worth</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Valuation Package or Marketing Package?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Getting a valuation is the best way to internally understand where improvement opportunities exist for creating value. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A business valuation is an internal product and should not be shared with a potential buyer. Why? A business valuation will have a more conservative review with payroll, marketing, and other expenses that will be adjusted differently and more aggressively under a marketing package. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The sole purpose of a marketing package is to show the opportunity, minimize the risk, and create value in the business that may not exist today. For this reason, marketing packages are invaluable for business owners who are</span> <a href="https://www.johnsonconsulting.com/when-is-it-the-right-time-to-put-my-funeral-home-for-sale/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">ready to sell NOW</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Time to Create a Marketing Package</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As you begin the process of selling your business, you’ll need to get a professional marketing package created. Not only are marketing packages critical for any qualified buyer to review, but they also can give you an accurate picture of how much money you should ask for.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If the value from the marketing package doesn’t end up where you want it, then it may be best to hold off selling until you can make proper adjustments to your operations. At Johnson Consulting Group, we can help you </span><a href="https://www.johnsonconsulting.com/ive-gotten-a-valuation-now-what/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">create a post-valuation plan</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to improve your enterprise value. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Understand Tax Implications</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When selling a funeral business, it’s essential to understand the entire picture of tax implications. Particularly for those who plan to retire after a sale, it’s imperative that you account for the potentially large taxes that follow a sale. Otherwise, you might have an unpleasant surprise come tax season. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In most cases, it’s best to seek some outside help. A consultant who specializes in the funeral industry can help your tax accountant and attorney best minimize your tax burden. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Buyers Matter</span></h2>
<p><a href="https://www.johnsonconsulting.com/finding-a-business-buyer/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Finding the right buyer</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for your business can be a challenging process, one that will ultimately depend on the current state of the market as well as your ability to leverage your network. In most cases, an ideal buyer will be one already affiliated with the funeral services profession.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The funeral profession is a small network and many of the buyers are known. How you engage with those buyers depends on a well-constructed marketing package, confidentiality, and a timely process. This will ensure your success to maximize your value. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You may already have a buyer in mind, and that buyer would hope you would only talk to them. There are few buyers, if any, that would want to work with you indirectly through a broker. This is because they know they will have to pay more for the business. Ironically, all buyers would agree that a process that includes a broker is more organized, flows better, and is more timely to a close. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In summary, to maximize value, more than one buyer needs to be involved and it must be a structured process. Keep in mind that the highest price may not come from the buyer you thought would pay the most. At Johnson Consulting, we like to have 7-10 buyers involved in each marketing package. We are continually surprised by who the ultimate buyer is, as opposed to who we thought the buyer would be. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Work With Industry Experts</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Selling a business is a complex process, the success of which will drastically impact your next steps in business and life. It’s essential to seek the outside expertise needed to execute a sale right. It’s surprising to see business owners who commonly use a real estate agent to sell their home, but not using an expert to sell the most valuable asset they own — which is their funeral business. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If the industry expert does their job, they will increase the value which will accomplish two things: put extra money in the owner’s pocket and pay for the consultant without infringing on the value the owner receives. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At Johnson Consulting Group, our team of death care professionals can help you through every step of the process, from obtaining a valuation, finding a buyer, and brokering an eventual sale. With our collective decades of experience in the field, our consultants, accountants, and brokers can help you plan an exit strategy from the ground up, aligning your goals with the potential of your business. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It all starts by partnering with us. By conducting a holistic examination of your funeral home, we can help you determine where your business currently stands and what needs to be done before a sale. </span><a href="https://www.johnsonconsulting.com/contact-us/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reach out today</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to schedule a consultation.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When selling a funeral business, it’s essential to understand the concept of multiples. Represented as a numerical value, a multiple can be used to compare the values of similar businesses, and it’s also a key factor in determining the right price for a sale. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Multiples are based on a number of factors, including the specific industry as well as a business’s size and profitability. When you are considering what multiple to pay, it is the same as considering how many years of cash flow you feel confident you will receive from your purchase. It’s the number of years of cash flow you are buying.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In this guide, we’ll review the importance of multiples, how they’re assessed, and what’s considered a “good” multiple for the death care profession. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">What’s a Good Multiple When Selling a Funeral Business?</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When planning to sell your funeral business, you’ll need to </span><a href="https://www.johnsonconsulting.com/consistent-funeral-home-valuation-important/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">obtain a valuation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and during this process, the appraiser will determine a multiple range for your business. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Multiples vary greatly by industry. In the death care industry, a multiple of six to ten is considered a good range for mid-to-large size businesses. However, this multiple will vary based on factors such as the current economy, lending rates, as well as the business’s case volume, market share, and historical trends. A business’s value is dictated by the level of opportunity and risk. The higher the opportunity and the lower the risk, the higher the multiple. How you demonstrate the opportunity and the risk depends on how well your marketing package and presentation is put together. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">How Can You Improve Your Multiple?</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For many funeral business owners, improving multiples will be an essential step to take before putting a business up for sale. There are several proven ways to increase one’s multiple, and many of them dovetail with </span><a href="https://www.johnsonconsulting.com/7-strategies-to-increase-your-funeral-homes-value-over-time/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">boosting a business’s valuation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Getting Regular Valuations</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Getting regular valuations is an important step for any funeral business looking to improve its multiple. Valuations not only provide you with a top-down assessment of current performance, but they can also help identify areas of weakness in the business, which can then be addressed. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When performed annually, valuations can track the progress of a funeral business over time and help establish realistic expectations for the company’s future. We often ask how often clients look at their investments in stocks/bonds/cash, most likely they are looking on a monthly or annual basis. Funeral business owners rarely look at their own business’ value, which is ironically the most valuable asset they own. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Understand Your Financials</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While some funeral business owners can tell you how profitable their company is, fewer can readily report the deeper financial picture. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To increase a funeral home’s multiple, it’s essential for leadership to have a comprehensive understanding of the company’s current financial position and to be able to accurately interpret financial trends and performance. This includes clear and concise profit &amp; loss/income statements, and balance sheets.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Set Goals for Growth</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Setting goals for growth is also critical for improving a business’s multiple. By creating goals and executing a budget and plan to achieve them, your business can begin addressing any issues that caused it to obtain a less-than-ideal valuation. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A good place to start this process is with a </span><a href="https://www.johnsonconsulting.com/services/business-consulting/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">JCG performance analysis.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Gathering</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> key stakeholders and discussing the funeral home’s strengths and weaknesses in its </span><a href="https://www.johnsonconsulting.com/4-pillars-of-success/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">4 pillars of success</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is critical. By doing this, you can create a </span><a href="https://www.johnsonconsulting.com/strategic-plan/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">strategic plan</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that sets your business up for greater valuations.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Invest in Your Team</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Payroll is the highest expense within your company, and it’s gone up at least 5-10% of net sales in comparison to recent years. Is your labor pool an asset or liability to the business’s success in the future? Bottom line: invest in your team.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Furthermore, higher turnover rates and employee dissatisfaction can hurt your valuation. You should implement strategies to </span><a href="https://www.johnsonconsulting.com/how-to-recruit-and-retain-top-talent-for-your-funeral-business/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">recruit and retain top talent</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. In many cases, to optimize the performance of your teams, leadership may create </span><a href="https://www.johnsonconsulting.com/4-components-incentive-compensation-plan/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">incentive compensation plans</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that reward top performers within your organization.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lean on Funeral Home Consultants</span></h2>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="_04xlpA direction-ltr align-start para-style-body"><span class="S1PPyQ">Serving the community since the early 1900s, this firm was actively committed to growing and evolving with the needs of their community, making them a staple and a familiar face to the families in their surrounding towns. As time went on, they expanded their services to two locations as the town continued to expand. Through each and every transition, this firm held the love for their community and families above all else. Their knowledgeable, friendly staff, stunning facilities, and fair pricing made them a stand out firm in the profession.</span></p>
<p class="_04xlpA direction-ltr align-start para-style-body"><span class="S1PPyQ">In the early 1950s, the original owner retired and sold the firm to a new owner who has continued to be part of this special community providing guidance and actively serving families ever since.</span></p>
<h2><span class="S1PPyQ">The Situation</span></h2>
<p class="_04xlpA direction-ltr align-start para-style-body"><span class="S1PPyQ">This owner knew selling was in his future, but also knew there were a few things that needed to be taken care of before he went down that road, the first being getting his finances on track and organized. His initial engagement was with JCG’s accounting services where he worked with their experts to help manage his expenses.</span></p>
<p class="_04xlpA direction-ltr align-start para-style-body"><span class="S1PPyQ">This owner also had some issues internally that required addressing before he could sell. He used J3Tech’s Performance Tracker X to get a true look at his business so he could clearly see what areas needed improvement.</span></p>
<p class="_04xlpA direction-ltr align-start para-style-body"><span class="S1PPyQ">When it was time to start down the path of selling, the owner reached out to JCG for their brokerage services. It was important that whoever the new buyer was would understand the role they played in their community and would continue that legacy. They also of course wanted top dollar for their business, and needed a team that would negotiate professionally and advocate for their best interest at all costs.</span></p>
<p class="_04xlpA direction-ltr align-start para-style-body"><span class="S1PPyQ">After learning all of this critical information about the owner, firm and community, it was time for the JCG team to determine the full valuation for their firm.</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><strong><span class="S1PPyQ">The initial valuation of this firm was between 4.4M &#8211; 4.8M before working with JCG in 2019.</span></strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<h3><span class="S1PPyQ">To determine Starting Value, JCG used the following criteria:</span></h3>
<ul>
<li><span class="S1PPyQ">Thorough analysis of their past, present and projected sales</span></li>
<li><span class="S1PPyQ">Detailed market assessment including demographic trends</span></li>
<li><span class="S1PPyQ">Detailed study of historical death trends for their market</span></li>
<li><span class="S1PPyQ">Analysis of all critical and non-critical assets</span></li>
<li><span class="S1PPyQ">Thorough review of minimizing taxes</span></li>
<li><span class="S1PPyQ">A thorough study of their payroll, compared to profession standards</span></li>
<li><span class="S1PPyQ">A review of purchase structures before going to market</span></li>
<li><span class="S1PPyQ">Review of their financial statements to determine future projected cash flow</span></li>
<li><span class="S1PPyQ">Inventory and excess acreage needs for their businesses</span></li>
<li><span class="S1PPyQ">Consideration and discussion of life after the deal</span></li>
<li><span class="S1PPyQ">Review to ensure successful retirement.</span></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><strong><span class="S1PPyQ">By the end of 2021 after working with JCG’s business consultants and accounting team, this firm’s value increased to between $6-$6.5M.</span></strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<h2><span class="S1PPyQ">The Solution</span></h2>
<p class="_04xlpA direction-ltr align-justify para-style-body"><span class="S1PPyQ">This firm got the benefits of working with JCG’s experienced brokerage team. This meant having a custom marketing package put together with the exact information that would get buyers attention and interest to maximize value that is above and beyond what a seller could achieve on their own.</span></p>
<p class="_04xlpA direction-ltr align-justify para-style-body"><span class="S1PPyQ">JCG worked to get this firm in front of multiple buyers under a structured and confidential process. The result of this process combined with the prior work generated an extraordinary offer well above their initial valuation.</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><strong><span class="S1PPyQ">Final Purchase Price: $7.3 Million Dollars</span></strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<h2><span class="S1PPyQ">The Results = Increased Value</span></h2>
<p><span class="S1PPyQ">This client was able to increase their profitability with the help of JCG&#8217;s experienced consultants, accounting team, as well as utilizing the </span><a href="https://www.j3techsolutions.com/performance-tracker/"><span class="S1PPyQ">Performance Tracker X </span></a><span class="S1PPyQ">software</span><span class="S1PPyQ">.</span><span class="S1PPyQ"> This allowed the client to be set up to get top dollar when they were ready to sell.</span></p>
<p><span class="S1PPyQ">By taking the needed steps guided by JCG, this client was able to get an offer that was over $3 million over their initial valuation in a final purchase offer!</span></p>
