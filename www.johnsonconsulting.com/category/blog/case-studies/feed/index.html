<p>The <a href="https://www.johnsonconsulting.com/services/performance-tracker-x/">JCG Performance Tracker X</a> tool provides funeral homes and cemeteries timely, accurate measurements of customer service and sale performance.  The software offers comprehensive reporting that shows business owners what they are doing well and identifies the areas that need fine-tuning and improvements.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Johnson Consulting Group started its customer survey program in 2008. This large amount of survey data has proven invaluable to providing insight into customer needs and satisfaction. The company attributes the program’s growth based on its ability to offer the program with no contract to sign, a low monthly cost, and accessibility to its management professionals for interpretation and usefulness of the reports.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“With the commoditization of products and services in our society, providing an exceptionally high level of customer service is critical to differentiating us from our competition. At the average sale of a funeral today, the loss of even one family can have material impacts on a business and its value. The answer to continual improvement is to survey our customers, ask the difficult questions, ask for a review online, and recover when there&#8217;s an issue”, says Jake Johnson, President and CEO of Johnson Consulting Group.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="_04xlpA direction-ltr align-start para-style-body"><span class="S1PPyQ">Serving the community since the early 1900s, this firm was actively committed to growing and evolving with the needs of their community, making them a staple and a familiar face to the families in their surrounding towns. As time went on, they expanded their services to two locations as the town continued to expand. Through each and every transition, this firm held the love for their community and families above all else. Their knowledgeable, friendly staff, stunning facilities, and fair pricing made them a stand out firm in the profession.</span></p>
<p class="_04xlpA direction-ltr align-start para-style-body"><span class="S1PPyQ">In the early 1950s, the original owner retired and sold the firm to a new owner who has continued to be part of this special community providing guidance and actively serving families ever since.</span></p>
<h2><span class="S1PPyQ">The Situation</span></h2>
<p class="_04xlpA direction-ltr align-start para-style-body"><span class="S1PPyQ">This owner knew selling was in his future, but also knew there were a few things that needed to be taken care of before he went down that road, the first being getting his finances on track and organized. His initial engagement was with JCG’s accounting services where he worked with their experts to help manage his expenses.</span></p>
<p class="_04xlpA direction-ltr align-start para-style-body"><span class="S1PPyQ">This owner also had some issues internally that required addressing before he could sell. He used J3Tech’s Performance Tracker X to get a true look at his business so he could clearly see what areas needed improvement.</span></p>
<p class="_04xlpA direction-ltr align-start para-style-body"><span class="S1PPyQ">When it was time to start down the path of selling, the owner reached out to JCG for their brokerage services. It was important that whoever the new buyer was would understand the role they played in their community and would continue that legacy. They also of course wanted top dollar for their business, and needed a team that would negotiate professionally and advocate for their best interest at all costs.</span></p>
<p class="_04xlpA direction-ltr align-start para-style-body"><span class="S1PPyQ">After learning all of this critical information about the owner, firm and community, it was time for the JCG team to determine the full valuation for their firm.</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><strong><span class="S1PPyQ">The initial valuation of this firm was between 4.4M &#8211; 4.8M before working with JCG in 2019.</span></strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<h3><span class="S1PPyQ">To determine Starting Value, JCG used the following criteria:</span></h3>
<ul>
<li><span class="S1PPyQ">Thorough analysis of their past, present and projected sales</span></li>
<li><span class="S1PPyQ">Detailed market assessment including demographic trends</span></li>
<li><span class="S1PPyQ">Detailed study of historical death trends for their market</span></li>
<li><span class="S1PPyQ">Analysis of all critical and non-critical assets</span></li>
<li><span class="S1PPyQ">Thorough review of minimizing taxes</span></li>
<li><span class="S1PPyQ">A thorough study of their payroll, compared to profession standards</span></li>
<li><span class="S1PPyQ">A review of purchase structures before going to market</span></li>
<li><span class="S1PPyQ">Review of their financial statements to determine future projected cash flow</span></li>
<li><span class="S1PPyQ">Inventory and excess acreage needs for their businesses</span></li>
<li><span class="S1PPyQ">Consideration and discussion of life after the deal</span></li>
<li><span class="S1PPyQ">Review to ensure successful retirement.</span></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><strong><span class="S1PPyQ">By the end of 2021 after working with JCG’s business consultants and accounting team, this firm’s value increased to between $6-$6.5M.</span></strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<h2><span class="S1PPyQ">The Solution</span></h2>
<p class="_04xlpA direction-ltr align-justify para-style-body"><span class="S1PPyQ">This firm got the benefits of working with JCG’s experienced brokerage team. This meant having a custom marketing package put together with the exact information that would get buyers attention and interest to maximize value that is above and beyond what a seller could achieve on their own.</span></p>
<p class="_04xlpA direction-ltr align-justify para-style-body"><span class="S1PPyQ">JCG worked to get this firm in front of multiple buyers under a structured and confidential process. The result of this process combined with the prior work generated an extraordinary offer well above their initial valuation.</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><strong><span class="S1PPyQ">Final Purchase Price: $7.3 Million Dollars</span></strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<h2><span class="S1PPyQ">The Results = Increased Value</span></h2>
<p><span class="S1PPyQ">This client was able to increase their profitability with the help of JCG&#8217;s experienced consultants, accounting team, as well as utilizing the </span><a href="https://www.j3techsolutions.com/performance-tracker/"><span class="S1PPyQ">Performance Tracker X </span></a><span class="S1PPyQ">software</span><span class="S1PPyQ">.</span><span class="S1PPyQ"> This allowed the client to be set up to get top dollar when they were ready to sell.</span></p>
<p><span class="S1PPyQ">By taking the needed steps guided by JCG, this client was able to get an offer that was over $3 million over their initial valuation in a final purchase offer!</span></p>
