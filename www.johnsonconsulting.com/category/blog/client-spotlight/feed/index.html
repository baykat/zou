<p><strong><u>Scottsdale, AZ –</u></strong>Johnson Consulting Group (JCG) announced the recipients of the <strong><em>JCG 2024 Excellence in Customer Service Awards, powered by J3Tech Solutions.</em></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Awards were presented to JCG client funeral homes who achieved the highest Total Value Index Score from family satisfaction surveys sent to each family they served during 2024. The Total Value Index is a calculation of the weighted sum of the Overall Performance Score, the Net Promoter Score and the “value of the price paid for goods and service” question. The Overall Performance Score is a calculation of eighteen independent questions that measure results in four areas: 1) Initial Contact, 2) Arranging Director, 3) Facilities and Vehicles, 4) Staff and Services Provided.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The JCG client funeral homes are divided into three categories based on call volume. Award recipients achieved the highest levels of customer satisfaction among the 576 funeral homes that were eligible in 2024.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.johnsonconsulting.com/services/performance-tracker-x/">JCG Performance Tracker X</a> tool provides funeral homes and cemeteries timely, accurate measurements of customer service and sale performance.  The software offers comprehensive reporting that shows business owners what they are doing well and identifies the areas that need fine-tuning and improvements.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Johnson Consulting Group started its customer survey program in 2008. This large amount of survey data has proven invaluable to providing insight into customer needs and satisfaction. The company attributes the program’s growth based on its ability to offer the program with no contract to sign, a low monthly cost, and accessibility to its management professionals for interpretation and usefulness of the reports.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“With the commoditization of products and services in our society, providing an exceptionally high level of customer service is critical to differentiating us from our competition. At the average sale of a funeral today, the loss of even one family can have material impacts on a business and its value. The answer to continual improvement is to survey our customers, ask the difficult questions, ask for a review online, and recover when there&#8217;s an issue”, says Jake Johnson, President and CEO of Johnson Consulting Group.</p>
