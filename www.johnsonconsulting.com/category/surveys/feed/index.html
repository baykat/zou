<p><strong><u>Scottsdale, AZ –</u></strong>Johnson Consulting Group (JCG) announced the recipients of the <strong><em>JCG 2024 Excellence in Customer Service Awards, powered by J3Tech Solutions.</em></strong></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.johnsonconsulting.com/services/performance-tracker-x/">JCG Performance Tracker X</a> tool provides funeral homes and cemeteries timely, accurate measurements of customer service and sale performance.  The software offers comprehensive reporting that shows business owners what they are doing well and identifies the areas that need fine-tuning and improvements.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Johnson Consulting Group started its customer survey program in 2008. This large amount of survey data has proven invaluable to providing insight into customer needs and satisfaction. The company attributes the program’s growth based on its ability to offer the program with no contract to sign, a low monthly cost, and accessibility to its management professionals for interpretation and usefulness of the reports.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“With the commoditization of products and services in our society, providing an exceptionally high level of customer service is critical to differentiating us from our competition. At the average sale of a funeral today, the loss of even one family can have material impacts on a business and its value. The answer to continual improvement is to survey our customers, ask the difficult questions, ask for a review online, and recover when there&#8217;s an issue”, says Jake Johnson, President and CEO of Johnson Consulting Group.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Providing outstanding customer service is a universal goal for businesses, but how do we truly know we’re meeting the mark? Assumptions are not enough. Instead, it requires a systematic approach to evaluate, analyze, and enhance the service we offer. Here’s a step-by-step guide to transforming your customer service process and driving continuous improvement.</p>
<h2><strong>1.The Service…Start with Self-Reflection</strong></h2>
<p>Before seeking external feedback, begin by assessing your current service delivery. This requires vulnerability—being open to recognizing shortcomings and embracing opportunities for growth. Evaluate your processes, interactions, and touchpoints. Where could improvements be made? Honest reflection sets the stage for meaningful progress.</p>
<h2><strong>2.Gather Client Feedback</strong></h2>
<p>Once you’ve acknowledged areas for improvement, the next step is to collect insights directly from your customers. <a href="https://youtu.be/UCbpHRqLhVg?si=IKAOcyZwlN-VMB4b" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Customer satisfaction surveys</a> are an excellent tool for this purpose. These can be distributed digitally (email), via text, or through traditional mail (paper).</p>
<p>Focus on these key areas:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>First Point of Contact</strong>: Often the lowest-rated section in surveys. Ask how the family’s initial interaction with your business felt and identify gaps.</li>
<li><strong>Arrangement Process</strong>: Gather feedback on the ease and efficiency of the arrangement process.  How did the arranger listen and provide the options?</li>
<li><strong>Facilities and Appearance</strong>: Evaluate impressions of your facilities, vehicles, and surroundings.  Have you provided a comfortable and quality environment for the customer.</li>
<li><strong>Service Experience</strong>: For those who utilized your service, dig deeper into their experience.</li>
</ul>
<p>Further questions should include perceptions of the overall value, how customers discovered you, their willingness to leave online reviews, and suggestions for additional services (lead generation).</p>
<h2><strong>3.Act on Feedback Quickly…Real Time Data</strong></h2>
<p>In the movie, “<em>The Godfather”</em>, bad news was expected to be delivered promptly! Similarly, receiving real-time data allows you to address issues immediately rather than letting them go unchecked.  <a href="https://www.johnsonconsulting.com/services/performance-tracker-x/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Johnson Consulting’s Performance Tracker System</a> allows you to leverage the latest technology, providing a rapid response to customer concerns.</p>
<h2><strong>4.Analyze the Data</strong></h2>
<p>Collecting feedback is only valuable if you analyze it effectively. Use robust reporting platforms to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Filter data by time frame, location, or region.</li>
<li>Identify trends and actionable insights.</li>
<li>Generate reports in real time for prompt decision-making.</li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>5.Deploy Actionable Improvements</strong></h2>
<p>With insights in hand, it’s time to implement changes. Review the data with your management team and assign tasks for execution. Ask:</p>
<ul>
<li>What improvements can we make?</li>
<li>Who will be responsible for these changes?</li>
<li>What is the timeline for implementation?</li>
</ul>
<p>Accountability and clear timelines ensure that your efforts translate into measurable results.</p>
<h2><strong>6.Invest in CX Performance Improvement</strong></h2>
<p>Customer experience (CX) isn’t a one-time fix; it requires ongoing commitment. Consider hosting <a href="https://www.johnsonconsulting.com/services/jcg-academy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Johnson Consulting’s CX performance improvement workshops</a> to bolster your service culture. John DiJulius’s book “<em><a href="https://thedijuliusgroup.com/product/the-customer-service-revolution/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Customer Service Revolution</a>”</em> is an excellent resource for understanding how to create a customer-first approach.</p>
<h2><strong>7.Generate Leads Through Exceptional Service</strong></h2>
<p>Satisfied customers naturally become ambassadors for your business. By prioritizing CX and deploying actionable improvements, you create raving fans who are eager to share their experiences. Encourage them to leave online reviews and share testimonials. This not only generates leads but also strengthens your reputation.</p>
<h2><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2>
<p>Customer service excellence is a continuous cycle. Start with honest self-assessment, gather and act on client feedback, analyze data, and implement changes. Invest in your team’s growth through CX workshops, and reap the rewards of lead generation from loyal, satisfied customers. Then, begin the process again to ensure ongoing improvement.</p>
<p>By following these steps, you’ll not only elevate your service standards but also foster a culture of excellence that drives lasting success.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Encouraging adoption by rewarding wins with some of the ideas below can get you moving in the right direction.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.johnsonconsulting.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Employee-engagement-cycle.png"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-7742 size-full" src="https://www.johnsonconsulting.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Employee-engagement-cycle.png" alt="Employee engagement cycle" width="846" height="479" srcset="https://www.johnsonconsulting.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Employee-engagement-cycle.png 846w, https://www.johnsonconsulting.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Employee-engagement-cycle-480x272.png 480w" sizes="auto, (min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 846px, 100vw" /></a></p>
<h2><strong>Incentive Compensation Plans</strong></h2>
<p>An <a href="https://www.johnsonconsulting.com/4-components-incentive-compensation-plan/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">incentive compensation plan</a> (ICP) is a form of variable compensation for your team members. A common practice is to tie the program to targeted sales, customers’ experiences, and the overall success of the organization. Incentive compensation plans can be customized to whatever metrics are important to the organization. They provide an extra dose of motivation for exceptional workplace performance and increase the chances of maintaining quality talent. Good ICPs must be understandable, fair, easily measurable, and consistent.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Without a doubt, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCbpHRqLhVg" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Performance Tracker X</a> has proved to be an important tool in easily managing ICPs. With Performance Tracker X, your team members can monitor their performance and ICP metrics in real time. This focuses their attention on the metrics that matter to you most while driving their personal growth and the growth of your organization. Increased focus increases survey communication with families which improves response rate and generates more actionable data.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>Employee Recognition</strong></h2>
<p>The care, compassion, and attention your arranging directors pay to the families they serve is of the utmost importance to them and can weigh heavily. Taking the time to appreciate and recognize successes has been shown to increase productivity, comradery, culture, and loyalty to the company, leading to higher retention.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are many creative ways to accomplish this which take little time or cost.</p>
<ul>
<li>Create an internal awards program for those who had the most perfect surveys responses received, highest response rate, and/or most digital collection.</li>
<li>A monthly “spin-to-win” game with gift cards or other give aways. Add your team members name to the wheel each time a perfect score survey is received.</li>
<li>Forward a congratulatory email each time a perfect score survey is received to the whole team. This allows everyone to feel each other’s success while publicly acknowledging the arranging director.</li>
<li>Highlight an arranging director each month on your social media including some of the positive feedback left in the surveys.</li>
<li>Read the positive feedback outload during team meetings.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Giving a little can get you a lot!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>Providing clarity and setting expectations</strong></h2>
<p>It is important that your team members understand organizational goals and the part they play in achieving those goals. Team members who cannot see beyond their role often feel a reduced sense of satisfaction and fulfillment which can lead to turnover, poor relations between coworkers, and an undesirable work environment. Help your team members to understand the importance of the survey program and how it plays into your larger vision by communicating often and across multiple channels and altitudes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>People retain information differently. Some may rely heavily on verbal communication whereas others may need written information, visual aids, or even examples of the concepts in action. Repetition of the information helps to engrain the importance and communicates that the direction you are providing is here to stay. Ensure adoption at all levels of your organization by breaking down high-level concepts and explaining how they relate to your team members’ day jobs. When you pair the newfound clarity with a framework which spells out the goals or criteria which support the mission, your team members become a part of the bigger picture rather than someone who is simply affected by it.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The satisfaction of shipping loved ones home for a funeral has seen a steady decline since 2018, even before the pandemic.(<a href="https://lp.constantcontactpages.com/su/wbJD0q4/PTX2022" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Johnson Consulting Group research Trends, and Insights see page 44</a>). According to the Wall Street Journal, it&#8217;s estimated that over 200,000 cases annually involve the transfer of a loved one over 300 miles for funeral services. This decline in satisfaction can be attributed to various factors, including the airline industry&#8217;s reduction and alteration of routes, as well as increased government red tape involving death certificates and staffing issues at health authorities.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>One potential solution to increasing satisfaction would be to have a dedicated person for shipping loved ones, but this could prove to be costly. Another approach would be to engage an experienced third-party entity experienced in shipping loved ones for ceremony. This solution involves dealing with a company that understands the intricacies of shipping within every state of the country, as well as with consulates and embassies in other countries remarks David W. McComb owner of Inman Shipping Worldwide the industry’s largest and most experienced transportation entity.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Johnson Consulting Group with the leadership of Jake Johnson, has been instrumental in producing survey results that illustrate the decline in customer satisfaction with shipping loved ones home for ceremony. It&#8217;s clear that addressing the challenges associated with this process requires collaboration with experienced entities and leveraging comprehensive survey data.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>By navigating the evolving landscape of shipping loved ones home for ceremony, it&#8217;s essential to prioritize expertise and insights from organizations such as Inman Shipping Worldwide and the Johnson Consulting Group.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As we wrapped up the year 2023, much like any other year, the funeral business landscape revealed its diverse facets. Across the United States, some firms appeared untouched by external influences, while others experienced the ebb and flow of challenges such as slow months, fluctuating death rates, and the overarching impact of the ongoing COVID pandemic. This period, which we&#8217;ve aptly termed the &#8220;COVID correction,&#8221; witnessed a shift in death rates back to levels reminiscent of 2019 or earlier, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">sparking a careful analysis of financial trends and the essential planning of financial strategies for the upcoming years.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The accelerated deaths due to COVID marked increase case volume years for the <a href="https://lp.constantcontactpages.com/su/Rn84BVG/PerformanceTracker2020" target="_blank" rel="noopener">funeral profession in 2021 and 2022</a>. However, as we stepped into 2023, the initial momentum slowed down, returning to a more typical caseload at most funeral homes. Yet, some establishments maintained their caseloads, highlighting the varying experiences across the industry.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This slowdown in case volume inevitably affected valuations. Some offers for funeral businesses were either stalled or withdrawn, accompanied by an uptick in interest rates. Funeral homes with variable interest rate loans and tight fixed charge coverage faced challenges, while those with careful financing and a mindful approach to debt-to-cash flow navigated the period with relative resilience. Despite the hurdles, my optimistic viewpoint leans towards a favorable outlook for the funeral business in 2024 and beyond as we emerge from the shadow of COVID.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the pivotal shifts during the pandemic was the transformation of the labor market. With the advent of remote work, rising inflation, and increased awareness of employment options, funeral businesses witnessed a notable increase in labor costs. This shift, though challenging, presents a dual perspective. On one hand, it offers an opportunity to attract and retain skilled employees who may have been underpaid. On the other, failure to adjust compensation may lead to staff seeking employment elsewhere, emphasizing the need for strategic decisions in response to changing labor dynamics.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rising cremation rates continued to leave their mark in 2023, with technology advancements enabling online cremation offerings and discounted options. While cremation&#8217;s popularity persists, funeral homes need to adapt to the evolving landscape of service offerings.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reflecting on valuations, 2021 and 2022 witnessed peak valuations, whereas 2023 introduced a more varied landscape. Premium firms continue to receive high valuations, but the range of offers expanded, differentiating between businesses prepared for market dynamics and those with unresolved issues. Well-prepared businesses, with a focus on budgeting, strategic planning, staff engagement, merchandising, and effective marketing, continue to stand out in the market.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As we stride into 2024, normalized projections for case volume, and stabilized or lowered interest rates offer a positive backdrop for funeral business acquisitions. The industry remains dynamic, with a steady flow of individuals interested in owning and growing funeral businesses. However, a discerning approach to evaluating future business prospects has become integral, considering the normalization of call volume after the unique challenges of 2021 and 2022.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The trajectory of labor costs seems to have found a balance, with some firms still navigating necessary adjustments. The anticipated &#8220;silver tsunami&#8221; of an aging population further underscores the importance of retaining a skilled workforce. Despite the challenges, the funeral space stands poised for growth, with a potential increase in case counts in the coming years.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In conclusion, meticulous attention to budgeting, forecasting based on trends, strategic planning, and a holistic review of various facets of funeral business operations are paramount. Whether considering succession planning, third-party involvement, or nurturing the next generation within the business, these considerations are not just essential; they are vital for the continued health and prosperity of funeral businesses and their impact on the communities they serve.</span></p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>As Benjamin Franklin once said, “In this world, nothing is certain but death and taxes,” so if you’re looking to enter a profession, funeral homes (or accounting) might seem like a lucrative choice. </p>
<p>The post <a href="https://www.johnsonconsulting.com/funeral-home-customer-experience/">Funeral Home Customer Experience: Measuring What You Can Manage</a> appeared first on <a href="https://www.johnsonconsulting.com">Johnson Consulting Group</a>.</p>
]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Let’s face it – there are plenty of uncontrollables in funeral business right? People not showing up on time, start time delays, weather – you name it. Unfortunately, those things do make an impact on funeral home customer experience whether we like it or not. This is why your staff must <em>control the controllables</em>, and it all boils down to performance.</p>
<p>Any successful funeral business needs to measure performance if they want to stay ahead of their competition, while also retaining families they’ve already served. Measuring performance helps owners and managers to identify areas where they can improve their services and maximize their profits. It can ensure that you are providing quality services while also improving your bottom line.</p>
<p>However, in order to do this, you need to make sure you know exactly what you should be tracking and how.</p>
<h2><strong>KPIs You Should Track for Your Funeral Staff’s Performance</strong></h2>
<p>Of course there are plenty of aspects you could be measuring within your business, the options are really endless. Tracking everything and anything can become overwhelming. At JCG, we believe that success in any firm boils down to two things<strong>: family satisfaction and profitability. </strong></p>
<h3><strong>Family Satisfaction</strong></h3>
<p>Everyone wants to think that the families that they serve are happy. Afterall, you didn’t get any complaints – right? If this is your mentality, you aren’t alone. The day-to-day grind can make it seem like your families are satisfied. However, if you don’t have the tangible data to back up your claim that your families are happy, the harsh reality is you really don’t know. It&#8217;s important to measure your interactions with families and team members in order to determine your team’s progress and development.</p>
<p>Remember this, losing just one family costs your enterprise value anywhere between $30,000 &#8211; $50,000!</p>
<h3><strong>Profitability</strong></h3>
<p>How profitable are you so far this year? Don’t worry – many funeral home and cemetery operators can’t answer that question with full confidence. It’s critical for you to measure each of your staff&#8217;s sales in order to know how to set goals to get to the next level. This means digging deep into your sales contracts and analyzing them from different angles of your business for the best possible outcome.</p>
<h3><strong>Tracking Funeral Business Performance Metrics</strong></h3>
<p>Understanding exactly what funeral business performance metrics to track allows business owners to identify necessary changes that need to be made, and what is working well, including staff that should be recognized and rewarded for their work. With this data, funeral businesses can also allocate resources according to what best serves family needs, making them more profitable.</p>
<h3><strong>Net Promoter Score (NPS)</strong></h3>
<p>The <a href="https://www.johnsonconsulting.com/what-is-an-nps-score-and-why-does-it-matter/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Net Promoter Score (NPS)</a> helps measure funeral home customer experience and loyalty levels towards their firm, and how likely they are to recommend it to someone else. It&#8217;s a great tool to use if you want to get an understanding of what your customers think about your staff and facilities.</p>
<p>It’s important to note though, that the NPS Score is NOT the only score you should be tracking, as you will be missing other key performance indicators.</p>
<h3><strong>Online Reviews</strong></h3>
<p>Monitoring and collecting your online reviews to review with your staff can be an effective way to motivate continuing great performance, while also opening up conversations to talk through any issues. Responding to negative reviews immediately is a great way to show families that you care as well.</p>
<p>The other key value to online reviews is that it drives families to your business. The more online reviews you can obtain, the more likely somebody will visit your business.</p>
<h3><strong>Case Count</strong></h3>
<p>It’s important to monitor how many calls you&#8217;re getting per month so that you can set realistic business goals.</p>
<h3><strong>Average Sale</strong></h3>
<p>The median sale your team produces is also an important metric in order to set yourself up for success. This helps you determine what your yearly profitability is going to be.</p>
<h3><strong>Income Statement (profit/loss statement)</strong></h3>
<p>Without tracking your <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/plstatement.asp" target="_blank" rel="noopener">P&amp;L’s</a>, it’s incredibly hard to determine if you’ve been successful for the month. This helps with the creation of budgets, guides spending, determines benchmarks, and more.</p>
<h3><strong>Sales By Arranger</strong></h3>
<p>Your team will be motivated by tracking their success month over month. This allows them to set goals and be rewarded based on their progress. You may find when tracking this that there is room for improvement and extra sales training might need to happen. If you happen to have multiple locations, it is extremely beneficial to track each one as well.</p>
<h3><strong>Creating an Action Plan</strong></h3>
<p>Now that you know what you should be tracking, it’s important to know exactly what to do with that data to make the right decisions for the future of your business.</p>
<h3><strong>Benchmarking</strong></h3>
<p>After assessing your financial health, it’s time to determine where you want to go. Doing your research to compare your success with other firms of your size can give you a framework for how well you are doing, or if you and your team need to step it up.</p>
<h3><strong>Create an Incentive Compensation Plan</strong></h3>
<p>Once you have your sales team&#8217;s numbers, it’s time to set goals for them. If you have a great staff and want to keep them, the best way to do this is to create an in-depth <a href="https://www.johnsonconsulting.com/4-components-incentive-compensation-plan/">incentive compensation plan</a>. This provides extra motivation for them to get rewarded for their performance and be part of the overall goals of the business.</p>
<h3><strong>Avoiding Burnout</strong></h3>
<p>Tracking all of this on top of your day job is impossible. We know the day-to-day grind gets in the way and staying on top of these numbers can feel overwhelming, even though it’s critical for your business health. That’s why we’ve poured so much time and resources into our <a href="https://www.johnsonconsulting.com/services/performance-tracker-x/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Performance Tracker X</a> to make your life easier.</p>
<p>Our funeral and tech experts designed this tool to make tracking the customer experience and profitability within funeral homes a breeze. With the ability to send surveys, monitor sales, create online reviews, and more, you have the power to improve your bottom line at your fingertips.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Funeral homes are increasingly finding themselves on the frontlines of the Coronavirus crisis. In order to maintain a high level of service, many firms are creating new funeral and memorial options such as live-streamed services for families affected by social distancing restrictions on large gatherings. Families may request these limited alternatives even after the pandemic ends, so understanding the current customer experience is crucial to the success of future marketing efforts for your funeral home.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now more than ever, keeping track of client satisfaction levels should be a high priority for your business. Customer surveys can help you evaluate if arrangement and service adjustments are meeting expectations, and how well your staff is doing overall. Here are the Top 5 reasons why funeral homes should survey their families during this health crisis:</p>
<h2></h2>
<h2>To Assess Customer Experience</h2>
<p>The 2020 pandemic has fundamentally changed how funeral services are arranged, which means that the general customer experience will be very different compared to what funeral directors have seen in previous years. One of the best ways to understand what families are going through during this health crisis is to request feedback via user-friendly surveys. After all, if you really want to know what a customer is thinking you should simply ask them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Many funeral homes use automatic survey tools to obtain responses from families, and some funeral directors openly ask for an honest review in person. With either method, the main objective should be to elicit descriptive comments and opinions that help improve customer service levels and build a loyal client base going forward.</p>
<h2></h2>
<h2>To Source Ideas for Growth</h2>
<p>Evaluating a family’s overall satisfaction with your funeral home is essential to understanding what works well vs. what doesn’t. To get an idea of which strategies are successful, consider using surveys to evaluate whether or not you are meeting customer expectations on a regular basis. Keep in mind that the COVID-19 crisis is causing some families to make rushed decisions and choose fewer services, and this unfortunate trend may continue even once the emergency tapers off. Funeral homes will need to be proactive in developing new and effective ways to reach families based on customer feedback, case mix and revenue projections.</p>
<h2></h2>
<h2>To Analyze Gaps in Customer Knowledge</h2>
<p>Customer surveys often reveal what people really think about your business. Their responses also provide crucial information regarding unseen gaps in consumer knowledge about the products and services your funeral home offers. For example, families who have lost a loved one to the coronavirus disease may ask for direct cremation only because they don’t know that they can hold a formal service before or after cremation. Professionally-written surveys can disclose key findings that inform the need for additional education and/or marketing to keep families current on their available options for saying a final goodbye.</p>
<h2></h2>
<h2>To Improve Staff Training</h2>
<p>Customer surveys can be customized to enhance staff training and improve performance. Survey responses offer insights into the arrangement conference and show exactly how much information families receive — these real-time results can help your staff focus on specific aspects of the funeral experience like financing, payment plans and empathy, and encourage them to reinforce these ideas with every family no matter the circumstances. This is especially important during the current health crisis when many families are under pressure to choose something (or anything) as quickly as possible. A well-trained arranger should be able to guide family members towards a decision that works well for everyone while still meeting sales performance targets.</p>
<h2></h2>
<h2>To Refine Aftercare Programs</h2>
<p>Funeral aftercare is just as important as pre-need or at-need care. Even during a pandemic when time and resources are very limited, funeral providers should make an effort to follow up with bereaved families to see how they are coping with their loss and to offer additional sympathy and care as necessary. Sending surveys after the service to ask for feedback can provide relevant information about overall satisfaction and average sales, and is also a great way to ask families to provide testimonials and/or reviews. Customer reviews are vital to your funeral home’s reputation and help establish a loyal community of future customers.</p>
<h2></h2>
